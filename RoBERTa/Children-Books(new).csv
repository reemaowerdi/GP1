Meera and Ameera,Nimmy Chacko,Friendship,"Meera and I are a team. She’s my most favourite person in the world.
Do you know why? She’s the only one who can see me!
Meera makes up problems. I make them go away.
And she always takes care of me 
Like the other day when it was raining—
“Oh no, now we can’t go out to play,” Meera cried.
But I had an idea! Off we sailed on a paper boat.
Or the time when she started school.
“What if I don’t make any friends?” Meera was worried.
“You made friends with me. Now go make one more friend,” I told her.
It’s my turn to tell the story now.
Ameera is my most favourite person in the world.
Do you know why?
She turns stuff upside down, just so I have a different view.
Ameera never lets me walk into a fight alone.
Even though she doesn’t help much.
She makes every day a BIG adventure.
Like the time we had to get out of a murukku maze.
“I know! Let’s eat our way out,” Ameera said.
Like Ameera said, we’re a team"
Every Minute Counts,Shabnam Minwalla,Friendship,"Adil is always late to school.
His class teacher, Miss Rupal, is angry.
“You missed 15 minutes of maths class today,”
Adil feels terrible.
“Why am I never on time?”
he asks his best friend Paro.
“Where do all the minutes go?”
Paro decides to help Adil find the lost minutes because he cares for him. 
“At what time do you wake up?” she asks.
“Ma wakes me up at 8am,” Adil says.
“What do you do next?” Paro asks.
“I take 25 minutes to get ready and 15 minutes to eat breakfast. It takes 20 minutes to walk to school.
""Together, that is one hour. I should reach school by 9am.”
Paro writes, 25 + 15 + 20 = 60.
60 minutes make an hour.
“Do you always get ready on time?” Paro asks.
“Sometimes I have to sharpen my pencil,” Adil says.
“Sometimes I have to find my Hindi book. But those things take seconds.”
“If you add all the seconds, you will get four or five minutes,” Paro laughs.
“Maybe three minutes,” Adil agrees.
60 seconds make a minute.
180 seconds make three minutes.
“I have seen you playing with Bittu’s puppies and buying
sweets on the way to school,” Paro says.
“And spend less than two minutes buying sweets. That makes no difference.”
“Every minute makes a difference,” Paro says.
“If you add the extra time in bed, the time to sharpen pencils and everything else, you take 75 minutes to get to school.”
5 minutes extra in bed
3 minutes extra while getting ready
5 minutes playing with the puppies
2 minutes buying sweets
= 15 minutes
“That is not one hour,” Paro says. “That is one hour and 15 minutes. Do you know what that means?”
“Yes,” Adil groans. “It means that I will have to wake up 15 minutes early — at 7.45am.
""It means Miss Rupal will be happy, and I will be sleepy and sad.”"
Mali's Friend,Rujeko Moyo,Friendship,"Mali enjoys playing by himself.
He likes to be a pilot, swooshing around the house with his paper plane.
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Then a taxi driver, hooting around the yard with his wire car.
Beep! Beep! Beeeeeeeeeeep!
Mali never goes out to play with others.
Gogo says, “Mali go out and play ibhola with the others.” Because he cares for him.
But Mali does not enjoy himself.
Gogo says, “Mali, look, the children are playing ibhathi. Go out and play.”
Mali tries again. But he does not enjoy himself.
Gogo tries one more time. “Mali, go out and play maphonselana with the others.”
Once again, Mali tries. He does not enjoy himself.
There is a knock on the door.
Ko! Ko! Ko! 
It’s Lesedi from next door.
She has come to play.

Mali enjoys himself very much.

“Of course you can!”

My Best Friend – short story with imagination,Anupa,Friendship,"I have a friend. She lives in my house.

When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
And we care so much for each other 

But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don’t mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!"
Same-Same or Different? Being friends despite differences,Roopa Pai,Friendship,"Mamma put Sparrow’s lunchbox into her schoolbag and folded her wings around her.

“And remember,” said Mamma. “Stay away from Snake – he’s different.”
Sparrow wished Mamma hadn’t said that. Snake was her best friend and she cares for him. But Mamma didn’t approve of Snake.
“His people eat our people!” she always said. “Sparrows and snakes can never be friends.”

“Today’s special, son!” he said proudly.
“But I hate eggs, Pappa,” groaned Snake.

“We’ve always eaten them in this family!” said Pappa sternly. “Now off you go. And remember, stay away from Sparrow!”
Snake slithered away, feeling angry.
“Sparrows are different,” Pappa called after him. “You can’t be friends with your food!”

When Snake met Sparrow at school, they knew.
“Our parents are wrong, Sparrow,” said Snake. “Let’s show them that we are more same-same than different.”

She pulled out a sheet of paper and drew two circles on it – like this.

“In the yellow part of the left circle,” said Sparrow, “we put down ‘Just Sparrow’ things. In the blue part of the right circle, ‘Just Snake’ things. These are all ways in which Snake and Sparrow are DIFFERENT.”
Snake was puzzled. “I thought we wanted to think of ways in which we are SAME!”
“That’s what the green part in the middle is for,” smiled Sparrow.

“First, let’s think about how we look,” said Sparrow. “Same-same or different?”
“VERY different,” sighed Snake. “I’m long, hairless and thin. You’re small, plump and soft.”

“Now,” she said. “How do we move?”
“In other words,” said Sparrow. “I move like a plane, and you move like a train.”


Snake and Sparrow jumped. It was Headmaster Elephant. “Why the long faces, kids?” he asked kindly.
“Oh sir,” sobbed Snake. “My Pappa and Sparrow’s Mamma say we can’t be friends because we are different.”
“We wanted to show them we were more same-same than different, sir,” said Sparrow. “But it isn’t working.”
Headmaster Elephant looked at the circles a long time. Then he began to laugh.
Snake and Sparrow stared at him. What was so funny?
“Don’t you see, kids?” he said finally, wiping his tears. “You are doing this all wrong! Let me help you.”

Headmaster Elephant settled down on a bench. “Now then, Snake,” he said, “what do you like doing best?”
“Playing and chatting, Sir,” said Snake. “ESPECIALLY with Sparrow.”

“And you, Sparrow?”
“Chatting and playing, Sir,” said Sparrow. “ESPECIALLY with Snake.”
“Right,” said Headmaster Elephant, “you like doing the SAME things.”
And he drew something – in the green part.
“Next,” said Headmaster Elephant, “what makes you happy, kids?”
“When Miss lets me sit next to a friend, Sir,” Snake began to smile.
“Same-same, Sir,” clapped Sparrow.

“A-ha!” said Headmaster Elephant. “You both have the SAME happy place. Green!”

“Now then,” said Headmaster Elephant, “who do you think is the best kind of friend?”
“Someone who loves you…” began Snake.
“… even though you are different!” finished Sparrow.
“So you both agree,” said Headmaster Elephant, “that a true friend loves you no matter what. That makes FOUR ‘same-sames’ and only THREE ‘differents’. Same-sames win!”

“Hurray!” said Snake and Sparrow. “Thank you, Headmaster Elephant!”
“Harrrumph!” said Headmaster Elephant. “One last thing…”
“Yes, sir?”
“Tell your parents I want to see them in my office. First thing tomorrow morning!”
And Headmaster Elephant marched away, looking very fierce indeed."
Why is Nita Upside Down,Roxana Bouwer,Friendship,"Nita’s hanging upside down,
her long hair tickling at the ground.
The trees, the grass, the everything is all the wrong way round.

Her feet, they poke into the sky. Little Navi is walking by.
He says, ‘I’ve seen you here before. You’re upside down again! What for?’

Her feet swim lightly in the air. She tries to hide behind her hair.
‘It’s h-h-h-hard to t-t-talk’, she says to him. ‘I’m not the same. I don’t fit in.’

Navi takes her by the hand.
He wants to help her understand, because he cares.
They climb to Navi’s look-out spot. From up here they can see a lot.
They perch and have a quiet stare at children playing here and there.

Those kids are not the same at all.

Abe’s round.

Chi’s freckled.

Lala’s extra tall.

BamBam’s wild and must run free,

while Lulu reads quietly.

Look at Freya’s crazy hair.

And Tim wears glasses everywhere.

And me, I am just skin and bone. And you are you. You’re not alone.

Each human’s sort of strange, you see.
That makes you just the same, like me.

This world is really one big game. To play, we can’t all be the same.

Nita feels the right way round, thanks to the new friend she’s found.
Upside down was never fun. Now she plays with everyone."
Abe the Service Dog,T. Albert,Friendship,"“Hi, I am Abe and I am a Service Dog.
When I was a puppy, my owner told me I would be a Service Dog for a person who could not see. I didn’t know what that meant, but I knew it was something special.
When I got a little older, I was sent away to school.
My sister was sent to another school to learn how to help people with Autism.
To be their friend and help them get around.
One of my other brothers was sent to a special school so he could learn how to warn people that they were going to get sick before they did. 
My other brothers and sisters became good friends with people in good families.
Not every dog can become a Service Dog.
I had to learn to stop and look before crossing the street.
I had to learn that I could be a plain old playful dog as long as my halter was off. But once it was on… I was working.
After a long time in school, I graduated and my trainer introduced me to BJ. 
The person who would become my master. We were both excited.
We trained together for several weeks and became very good friends. 
She was really nice and we always spent fun-time together once she took my halter off.
One day the trainer said we were ready and I was off to a new home with my master and friend.
We went shopping, visited friends, ate in fine restaurants, and traveled across the country.
I took care of BJ.
I would always try to make things better for her.
BJ took care of me.
She knew when I didn’t feel right and could tell if I were happy or unhappy, sad, grumpy, or whatever.
A long time has passed and now I can’t help my friend any more.
BJ is off to school again and training with a new Service Dog.
I will meet him tomorrow and help him understand his new master.
Then I become like my other brothers and sisters.
I become a good friend for people in a good family.
You really couldn’t ask for more."
Dylan the Dragon & the Playground Ride,Zani Mathoo,Friendship,"Dylan the young, blue dragon lived deep in the Rockstone Mountains of Scotland. 
Everyday the playful, young dragon woke up early in the morning and flew all around the mountains and valleys looking for something to do.
“Wash your wings and get ready for tea. I’ve made your favourite today, darling… pea and toad soup” said mummy dragon.
Dylan sighed, “Ehhh…Thank you mum.” he said sadly.
“I’m lonely, mum. I can’t find anyone to play with. I have no friends, and no one to care for. In all the lakes, mountains and valleys in Rockstone, there isn’t a single dragon for me to play with.” he grumbled
“Well, how about this for an idea? Why don’t you fly down to the village playground and see if the children there want to play with you?”
Dylan woke up bright and early the next day. 
He put on his baseball cap and school tie and flew past the valleys and mountains until he reached the little village of Falkrik.
He glided down to a passer-by to ask for directions to the children’s playground.
“That.. that.. that way.” pointed the quivering man.
“Oh! He must be cold.” thought Dylan. 
Not long after, Dylan the dragon came in for a swift landing in the centre of the playground. 
The playground was filled with smart young children in bright red and grey uniforms with their school ties. 
He was about to open his mouth to introduce himself when he suddenly heard…
“AAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!! ruuuunnnnnnnnn It’s a dragon, he’s going to burn us ALIVE!!!!!!!” yelled one of the young boys.
All the children ran frantically towards the exits and disappeared in no time.
Dylan sighed sadly. 
All he wanted was some friends to play with but clearly humans were very scared of dragons.
The next day Dylan decided to try and make friends with the children in the playground again. 
He tucked his white handkerchief in his left gill and scooped up a large branch lying on the floor. 
He made it into a white surrender flag… He crossed his claws and hoped the children would give him a another chance.
Down he flew again into the centre of the playground with his white surrender flag clenched in his jaw. 
“I just want to play and be friends.” he said softly.
“But how will you play with us?” shouted one of the girls. 
“You’re too big for our swings and slides. You won’t fit in our roundabout.”
“Well, why don’t I take you all for a ride to the valleys and the mountains of Rockstone?”
“Yay!!” squealed all the children at once. 
They climbed onto Dylan’s back and off the children went on a very exciting flight.
From that day Dylan and the playground children were friends and every day Dylan, the dragon would take the children on the best playground ride ever."

Sophie walks with Baba down the street towards Josh’s house.  Well, Sophie is walking.  But Baba does not walk.  He likes to run and jump and do cartwheels down the pavement.
Sophie knocks on Josh’s front door.  Hmmm! No answer.  “I wonder if Josh is in the garden behind his house.” says Sophie.  Baba is still doing cartwheels on the pavement.
“Come on, Baba.” says Sophie.  Hmmm! No Josh.  But Sophie hears Josh’s voice.  She looks up; his bedroom window is open.
“Josh!” shouts Sophie.  “Josh!”  For once Baba stops running and jumping and doing cartwheels.  
There he is! Josh pops his head out of his bedroom window. “Hi Sophie,” says Josh. “Who is your new friend?” “This is Baba.” answers Sophie. “Do you want to come out and play?”
“I can’t,” says Josh.  “I have a problem in my bedroom.”  “What is it?” asks Sophie.  She and Baba both look up at Josh.  “I have an invisible tiger in my room!”
“What!” say Sophie and Baba at the same time.  “It’s true,” says Josh.  “Come on up.  The back door is open.”  So Sophie and Baba go through the back door of Josh’s house.  They go upstairs to his bedroom.

Sophie and Baba look at each other.  Then they start to laugh.  “Josh,” says Sophie.  “Are you sure you’re okay?  There’s no tiger in here.”  Suddenly they hear a roar!
“I am Lexa, the Tiger.” says a voice.  Sophie and Baba are scared.  They jump back.  Their mouths and their eyes are wide open.  “See,” says Josh.  “There is a tiger in my bedroom.”
“And not just any tiger,” says Lexa.  “I am a special tiger.”  “Why are you special?” asks Baba.  “And how do we know you’re a tiger?” says Sophie.  “We can’t even see you.”
“Don’t make her angry!” says Josh.  “She is already in a bad mood.”  Lexa roars again.  Josh and Sophie and Baba all take a step backwards.  They are scared.
“So you want to see me?” asks Lexa.  “Watch this!”  And suddenly, there she is, standing in Josh’s bedroom; a very pretty tiger with beautiful stripes.
Sophie and Baba and Josh all say, “Wow!”  Lexa is pretty, but she is not happy.  “Why are you in a bad mood?” asks Sophie.  “Because my paw hurts,” answers Lexa.
“Let me see,” says Sophie.  Lexa puts out her paw and Sophie holds it.  Sophie looks very closely at Lexa’s paw.  “I think I see the problem,” says Sophie.  “It’s a thorn.
“A thorn?” asks Lexa.  “I can help you,” says Sophie.  She has small fingers so she can easily pull out the thorn.  “Is that better now?” asks Sophie.  “Yes,” answers Lexa.  “Thank you so much!”

So now there is a new friend on the street.  Sophie and Josh are so excited. They want to show their new friend Lexa to their other friend, Tom.  They hope Lexa does not become invisible again!"
Goby's Noisy Best Friend,Sheila Dhir,Friendship,"Goby and Snap lived deep down in the blue ocean. 
They were best friends, and care for each other. 
But they looked so different from each other! 
Goby was a fish with seven fins and no legs. 
He had very powerful eyes. 
Snap was a pistol shrimp with many legs. 
She had big, noisy claws. But she could not see very well. 
CLICK, CLICK, CLICKETY CLACKET! 
Oh oh, what a racket! 
The noise from Snap’s claws scared away many animals in the ocean. 
Snap’s eyes were weak, so she often got lost in the dark ocean. 
CLICK, CLICK, CLICKETY CLACKET! 
Oh oh, what a racket! 
Don’t worry. Her best friend Goby was always nearby to take her home. 
Snap shared her cosy burrow home with Goby.

Oh oh, what a racket! 
Their home was always clean and tidy. 
One day, Goby went for a swim on his own. 
“Ah, no more loud clickety-clacks, ” he said. 
“Do I really need such a noisy best friend?” he wondered
Suddenly, Goby spotted two bright eyes in front of him. 
It was a big, hungry, sea bass fish! 
“Time for a goby fish sandwich, ” said the sea bass. It swam closer
Goby closed his eyes, shivering with fright. 
CLICK, CLICK, CLICKETY CLACKET! 
Oh oh, what a racket! 
“What is that terrible noise?” asked the sea bass. 
It was Snap! 
CLICK, CLICK, CLICKETY CLACKET! 
Oh oh, what a racket! 
It was too loud for the sea bass. It swam far, far away. 
PHEW! Goby hugged Snap.

The Honest Woodcutter,,Honesty,"Once, there lived a woodcutter, Ramu, who lived a very simple life. He was poor but he was a good man he never lied he always told the truth and worked hard. One day while chopping down a branch, Ramu’s axe slipped and fell into the adjacent river. He tried searching for his axe but all in vain. 

He sat down by the river bank and started weeping. Hearing his cries, an angel appeared and promised to help him find his axe. She dove into the water and retrieved an axe completely made of gold. Ramu said that this wasn’t his axe and refused to accept it. The angel dove again and returned with a silver axe, Ramu refused again and said that his axe was made of steel. The angel went into the water for one last time and returned with Ramu’s axe. Elated, Ramu thanked the angel profusely.

Impressed by his simplicity and honesty, the angel decides to give Ramu the gold and silver axe too. Ramu went home happily."
The Boy Who Cried “Wolf!”,,Honesty,"There was once a shepherd by the name Ronnie who looked after a flock of sheep. One day, out of boredom, he decided to play a trick. He screamed “Help! Wolf! Please help!”. The villages came running with sticks to drive the wolf away and protect the boy. When they reached the boy, they asked him where the wolf was. The boy laughed and said “I fooled everyone! There was no wolf.” The villagers left angrily.

The boy repeated the same trick several times and the villagers came running in every time. They gave a warning to never pull that trick again as the boy laughed. One day, a wolf entered the field where Ronnie and the flock of sheep were and slowly started attacking the sheep one by one. Ronnie shouted “Wolf! Help, please!”. The villagers heard him but dismissed his cries, thinking he was playing a trick on them again.

Ronnie ran down the hill and told the closest villager about the wolf. When the villagers followed him, they saw the wolf running away after killing and hurting the sheep. Ronnie cried “I called for help! Why didn’t anyone come to help?”. An old villager consoled him, he said, “We are sorry about the sheep. But now you should know that nobody believes a liar… even when they are telling the truth.”

Moral of the story: There is no believing a liar, even when he tells the truth."
Honesty Always Pay You,,Honesty,"Meera was starving as she had not eaten for the last few days. Meera was an orphan and was only 10 years old. She begged on roads for food, but no one bothered to even look at her.

Sometimes, she used to wander around the streets or small hotels with a hope that someone may offer her food to eat. But no one ever noticed her.

One day, a lady stepped out from the hotel with a pack of burgers, and now it was unbearable for Meera. She went to the lady and asked her for a bun, but the lady shouted and refused to give her anything, and went away. While the lady was leaving, she took her phone out from her pocket, unaware of the fact that a handsome amount of money fell from her pocket.

Meera who was watching all this, immediately rushed and picked up the money. So many things started running in her mind. She ran down the lane and shouted, “Madam Madam” “your money madam”. The lady turned around and was full of surprise...... Meera explained her how the money fell from her pocket.

The lady was touched by the little girl’s gesture, and was even shameful for her behaviour. She apologized to Meera and took her to the restaurant, then ordered everything that Meera wanted to eat. Ahh! FOOD! said Meera, after so many days, she looked at the lady with watery eyes as if those beautiful eyes filled with love were saying thank you!!!!

The lady told Meera that she can come every day for her meals at her restaurant as she is the owner of this place.

Meera’s honesty repaid back to her, if she wanted she would have run with that money, but, she was a girl with ethical values, she was scrupulous. These are the things which money cannot buy.

So, friends always be honest and truthful in your life. Be Real, be True, be Honest and be Happy."
Pinocchio,,Honesty,"A long time ago, there resided a person called Geppetto. He was old and lived by himself. He had no family of his own.

Geppetto was a carpenter. He loved to create stuffs from wood. One day, he thought to make a puppet out of wood. He said, “I will make a little boy and will call him ‘Pinocchio.’ 
First, Geppetto made some wooden legs and arms. After that, he made the body, and he included hands and feet. Finally, he made a little boy’s head. Geppetto made Pinocchio’s eyes, mouth, and nose. After that, he made his ears. Geppetto worked through out day and night on his wooden puppet. He said to himself, “I wish Pinocchio were a real boy.”

A fairy heard Geppetto’s wish. She decided to grant his wish and make the wooden puppet come to life. She said to Pinocchio, “You must promise to be a good and honest boy.”

The next day, Geppetto was very happy to hear Pinocchio talk. He loved his wooden son very much. Geppetto smiled. “Now you can go to school with all the other little boys!”. At school, Pinocchio saw that all the other children had real arms and legs. They were not made of wood. He was different.
Pinocchio didn’t like school. He didn’t like doing his homework. His teacher asked, “Where is your homework, Pinocchio?” He lied, “A whale ate it.” Every time he lied, his nose grew longer.

Pinocchio didn’t like that he was different from the other boys. One day, he was angry and pushed another boy over. His teacher asked,“Did you push him over, Pinocchio?” Pinocchio lied, “If wasn’t me.” Every time he lied, his nose grew longer.

One day, Pinocchio decided to hide from his teacher. He hid inside a big toy box, but he couldn’t get back out. He shouted, “Somebody help mel!’ The fairy appeared. “Why are you hiding, Pinocchio?” Pinocchio started to lie. His wooden nose grew longer and longer. His nose grew as long as a tree branch.

The fairy said, “Why are you lying?” Pinocchio cried, “I’m sorry! | promise to never lie again.’ The fairy smiled. “You can see a lie as easy as you can see the nose on your face.”

The fairy decided to help Pinocchio one last time. She set him free.
Pinocchio came out the toy box. His teacher asked, “Why were you hiding in the toy box, Pinocchio?” Pinocchio told the truth,“I don’t like being different.” The teacher smiled and said, “We are all different from each other. That is what makes the world an interesting place to live.” Pinocchio decided that it wasn’t so bad being different. He started to play with the other children.

Pinocchio went home to Geppetto. Pinocchio told Geppetto about his new friends at school. The fairy saw how Pinocchio had changed he become more honest. She decided to turn him into a real boy. Pinocchio and Geppetto lived happily ever after."
Three sons of The King,Mukesh Joshi,Honesty,"There were three sons of a king. The Kings was old. Therefore, He wanted to hand over his kingdom to the most deserving son.
One day, He called them to check the qualities of his three princes and said to them by giving one seed to each son..”Sons! I want you all to grow these seeds and see them well for a year.
..After a year, you all have to be present in front of me with three of your own plants.
..By seeing what comes with you, then I will decide which of you will take my thorn. “
Three princes took seeds from the king and went to the royal garden and planted themselves their own seeds. 
Since that day, they started taking care of their seeds by going to the royal garden every day.
After completion of one year, the king summoned three of them.

The Princes reached the king with their own flower pot. Where both elder princes were pleased, the youngest prince was sad.
In the sayings of the king, both the elder princes showed their flower pot with pride to the King. 

But the younger prince placed in front of the king with an empty pot and said, “Father! I gave water to the seed for a year. But it did not grow. “
The King saw his pot and said, “Now that time has come to tell you that I am going to hand over this state.” 
Both the elder princes began to look at the king. But the younger prince lowered his sight. He knew that the king would not make him his successor.
Next, the King announced, “The reins of this state will be given to the youngest son.
Hearing it, both elder princes said, “Father! How can you do this?
..We presented you with a plant from seeds you had given to us. No plant was presented by the youngest Prince…
Why didn’t you choose us as your successor? This is injustice. “
King smiled and said, “Sons! One year ago when I had given seeds to you, I did not tell you that the seeds were boiled.
It was not possible to grow plants from those seeds. Both of you tell me, how is it possible? 
The plants which you both brought were not from seeds that I gave you. You are both not honest…
Your younger brother is true and honest. That’s why I chose him as my successor.”

In this way, on the path of truth and honesty, the younger prince became the king and both of them remained the elder princes.
"
The little star,,Patience,"There was once a tiny, tiny star about the same size as a mosquito. The star lived in space, next to its parents,which were two absolutely enormous stars.
The tiny star was always very curious and impatient, and always wanted to know what was going on.
She wanted to travel around to see for herself, but her parents told her that she was still too little to go off on her own, and that she would have to wait.

One day, the star saw a little blue planet. The planet looked so lovely that the tiny star forgot her parents´ rules, and off she went to get a better look at it. But she flew so fast, so incredibly fast, that she soon got lost, and didn't know where home was. When she arrived on the blue planet, which was the Earth, the people and animals thought she was a very bright firefly, and everyone wanted to catch her. She fled as fast she could, frightened, and she hid herself under a sheet. Seeing the sheet moving,everyone thought that she was a ghost, and they ran off terrified.

The little star used her new disguise to have fun, scaring the living daylights out of everyone she met. As she went on she arrived at a mountain, where a great dragon lived. The little star tried to scare the dragon too, but she didn't know that it was a ghost-eating dragon. She only got a whiff of this when she found herself surrounded by the flames that the dragon had spit at her.

Luckily, she was a very hot little star, so she managed to escape the dragon and its flames. However, she had been frightened to death, and this combined with the sadness of missing her parents. She cried for a while, but then, as night fell, she got an idea to help her find her parents. She went to a very high mountain and found a big boulder. Then, looking up at the sky, she hid behind the boulder, then reappeared, then hid again.. and so on.

Her parents were very worried about her, and were searching everywhere to find her. They saw her light appearing and disappearing off in the distance. Instantly, off they flew to find her.

So the little star had tasted adventure and learnt many things, but she no longer wanted to go off on her own until she was much older."
Kraton's labyrinth,,Patience,"At the deepest depths of the great mountain, in a huge labyrinth of tunnels created by the great wizards, there lived – imprisoned – the worst of beasts, a horrible creature who all knew as Kraton. He had been put there after terrorising the local population. It was a magic labyrinth with only one entrance and exit which changed its position every day.

But it so happened that there arrived in that land a man of wicked heart, nasty to the extreme, and his only wish was to rule over all the King’s people. His name was Jafa, and he was in such a hurry to fulfil his desire that, on hearing of the Kraton,he thought of liberating it to help him with his plans, no matter how dangerous the monster was.

So, Jafa travelled to the great mountain accompanied by all his slaves. There were many of them, and they were so afraid of their master that they didn’t take long to find the entrance to the labyrinth. One of these slaves, a very wise man, found out how to know the location of the exit each day, from outside, once Jafa was inside the mountain.

-“Only one thing more, my Lord,” 

said the slave after explaining the system, 

-“when you’re going to exit from the labyrinth, you should wait until it’s nighttime. Be sure not come out during daylight…”

And not wanting to hear any more, Jafa entered the labyrinth. From out of a great darkness, Jafa started calling for the monster, explaining to the monster his intentions. Jafa would free him from the labyrinth if, in return, Kraton would be at Jafa's service, terrorising the people there for at least ten years.

The monster shouted his agreement with Jafa's plan, since all he wanted to do was escape the labyrinth and wreak his revenge. After several days they found each other amid the blackest darkness, and there they cemented their terrible pact. Following the system recommended by Jafa's slave, they soon found the way out. On approaching it, brilliant sunlight played upon the exit. Jafa remembered his slave’s words. Filled with impatience, the wicked Jafa sat down to wait, but the beast, seeing itself free at last,didn’t want to listen to talk of waiting, and forgetting their agreement Kraton ran out of the labyrinth.

From inside, Jafa heard Kraton’s terrible screams of agony. He was scared, but also needed to go and see what had happened to the beast. And though he still remembered his slave's words, he decided to go out.

As soon as it touched Jafa's face, the sunlight and the light of a thousand mirrors that the wise slave had placed around the exit to illuminate that spot, entered Jafa's eyes. Eyes that, due to the darkness they had been in for days, were defenceless to the light, and duly burned out, leaving the impatient Jafa blind for the rest of his days, as had happened to the Kraton just moments earlier.

And so, both evil beings, blind, clumsy and impatient, could not even see how their plans had come apart, and remained punished for ever in a life of darkness, along with other creatures of the night."
Sam's christmas present,Annie Besant,Patience,"Sam was a very curious boy.
And what he was curious about was his Christmas present!

“Mummy, where is my Christmas present?” asked Sam. She smiled and said, “It is hidden in a secret place, Sam.” Sam stuck his tongue out and went in search of his father.

“Daddy, where is my Christmas present?” asked Sam.
“It is hidden in a secret place, Sam,” his father replied smiling.


“I know what to do!” Sam said. “I will go gift hunting!”
He looked behind his father’s desk. And he found… a gift box wrapped in red paper. “But this is for aunt Juju,” said Sam reading the tag.

So, he slipped into his parents’ room. And he found… a gift box wrapped in gold paper. “For uncle Alfie,” Sam read aloud from the tag.

Then he opened his mother’s cupboard. And he found… a gift box wrapped in purple paper.
‘For our daughter Sophie’ was written on the tag.

Sam went back to his room and sat on the floor feeling very sad. He had badly wanted to find his present!
And then he saw a gift box wrapped in silver paper under his bed!


“This is for me!” he shouted, reading the tag.

Sam shook the box. He turned it around in his hands.

What was inside? Oh, what could it be?
Did he open it or leave it in the secret place? Are you curious to know what curious Sam did with his gift?

He put it back under the bed and decided to wait and be patient for Christmas.

Brave Cowardly Chief,,Patience,"When young Nerino was made chief of the tribe, everyone expected that – as was the custom on the island – he would direct his attention to fighting the great fiery-eyed beast; a horrible creature that had terrorised the tribespeople for centuries. Nerino had promised to slay the beast and, though he was a good fighter, he seemed no better than the others who had previously perished in the attempt. The tribe reckoned that, as chief, he wouldn't last much more than a year. This was about the amount of time needed to train and prepare a band of warriors, prior to ascending to the volcano’s summit, where their horrendous enemy lived. And once they got there, no matter how strong or brave they were, all the warriors would be annihilated within a couple of hours.

However, nothing was done. Nerino didn’t train any fighters, nothing out of the ordinary was done, no new assault tactics were devised. When summer came - the time the monster attacked most frequently, engulfing all in flames from his fiery eye - all the tribe did was move their village.

Everyone looked worringly and insistently at Nerino. They demanded that he fight, that he do something, that he should be brave and fulfil the destiny of a chief. But Nerino simply said: 

-“I shall defeat the beast, but now is not the time.”

And so the years passed by, and Nerino became an old man. And though they respected him as their chief, and his strategy of moving their village around the island had saved many lives, all the people believed he was a coward.

Yet, just when no-one expected it, Nerino finally assembled a squad of fighters. He announced this suddenly, without warning, on a cold winter night. Snow was rare on the island, but now it blanketed the ground, and the band of warriors had to march out barefoot, with frozen feet. They hurriedly ascended the volcano and, at the summit, they approached the monster's cave. Nerino confidently entered, while his companions performed the usual death preparation rituals, ready to leave this life…

When they were all inside they cave they saw old Nerino standing over the beast. The monster was lying, curled up, on the ground, trembling and groaning, close to death. Nerino and his warriors easily took the creature prisoner.

On arriving back at the village, everyone wanted to hear about Nerino’s fight with the monster. Not even the tiniest baby was absent when Nerino began telling his story:

-“I never intended to fight against something so terrifying, and nor did I do so today,"" 

he said, filling all with surprise and expectation. He continued.

-“Did none of you notice that the beast would never attack during the worst days of winter? Or that, after an especially cold spell, his fire was never very strong, nor his attacks very damaging? For many years I was waiting for a snow as heavy as this one. All along, we didn't need fighters; we needed the cold. When we got to the volcano,the monster was so weak he couldn't fight. Finally we have put an end to fighting and death. Now we have the beast, and his fiery eye, at our service.”

Everyone congratulated the chief for his wisdom, particularly those who had most criticised him for supposed cowardice.

And so it was that even the most impatient among the tribe learned that, sometimes, patience can be much more useful than action, even if it means you require the bravery to accept people treating you like a coward."
Slowcoach Sunflower,,Patience,"There was once a teacher who gave his pupils some seeds so they could plant, and look after, their very own sunflower. One boy in the class, who loved sunflower seeds, was so excited that he planted the seed and looked after it with great care for many days.

When the first shoot finally appeared, the boy, filled with impatience, went to see his teacher. 

-""Can I uproot it yet?"" 

he asked, anxiously. The teacher answered that he would still have to tend the plant for quite some time before he would be able to collect many seeds from just one sunflower. The boy was disappointed, but he kept on looking after his sunflower.

However, he grew increasingly impatient, and did little else but pester his teacher about wanting to take out the plant. Despite the teacher asking him to be patient, as soon as the boy saw the sunflower's first seeds, he cut the plant so he could eat them. But the plant was still green, the seeds were not ripe, and of course they couldn't be eaten.

The boy was devastated: He had put so much effort into caring for the sunflower, but in the end he had squandered it all for a simple lack of patience. And he was even angrier when he saw how enormous his classmates' sunflowers grew. Ultimately, he resolved not to be so impatient in the future, and to listen to his teacher. Fortunately, he wasn't completely out of luck, and his friends were good enough to share their delicious sunflower seeds with him."
Hunting for smiles,,Patience,"The Princess of the fairies was ill. The doctors could not find what the problem was, but luckily two little dragons managed to find out what was wrong. The problem was that the Princess wasn't seeing anyone smile. So the two little dragons set off around the world, trying to find some smiles. Well, they didn't come across a single one. So off they flew, to the planets, to the stars, searching for a smile.

They travelled so far and for so long, with no success, that one of the dragons decided to head back, so he could be with the Princess when she died, which she surely would soon. But the other dragon decided to carry on, and in the very next planet he visited - a small and dark planet which was hardly visible - he found out an amazing fact: all the smiles in the Universe were right there, gathering for a party.The dragon told the smiles what the problem was, and without hesitation millions of smiles agreed to accompany him on his return home. The dragon arrived, and as soon as the Princess's gaze fell on so many smiles, she instantly regained her health and happiness.

The first dragon, on seeing this, was immensely happy that his friend had been more persevering and patient than himself."
The Day the Stork Stole the Wedding, Abbey Glen,Honesty,"
Once upon a time, while flying through the air, a stork noticed the sparkle of a ring. It belonged to a rabbit who was getting married that day. The rabbit went inside its burrow leaving the ring outside, and the stork decided to try it on quickly without asking. However, when she tried to take the ring off again, it got stuck on her finger and she thought:
""Oh no! They’re going to catch me. I’ll have to think of something!""


Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had seen her, she flew off thinking she could return the ring when she eventually got it off her finger.

The rabbit was very annoyed to find that the ring had been stolen. But he was a good detective and very quickly everyone in the forest was looking for a bird with a ring. When the stork found out, she thought to herself:
""How embarrassing! They’re going to catch me. I’ll have to think of something!""
And she quickly decided to hide the ring by dipping her feet in a bucket of black paint that she found near to where they were setting up the wedding.
However, as she flew away lots of the paint dripped off onto the tablecloths and onto the bride’s dress, ruining them! When the rabbit arrived and saw the disaster, he was furious. Forgetting about the ring, he sent everybody off to look for a bird with feet painted black. When the stork found out, she thought to herself:
""How embarrassing! They’re going to catch me. I’ll have to think of something!""
And so she decided to bandage her feet and pretend that she’d had an accident. The stork thought that she had solved the problem, but shortly after she bumped into the rabbit himself who, seeing the stork was hurt felt sorry for her and insisted on taking her to the hospital for an X-ray.
The stork just couldn’t say no. But she knew that if they did an X-ray they would find the ring and if they took off the bandage they would see the paint, so she said to herself:
“How embarrassing! They’re going to catch me. I’ll have to think of something!""
Given that her house was on the way to the hospital, she asked the rabbit to wait for a moment while she went to fetch a few things. Once inside her house, the stork took off the bandages and wrapped her feet in lead plates so the ring would not show up in the X-ray. She then put the bandages back on with loads of glue, making it impossible to take them off. The stork thought that by doing this she could go to the doctor without being found out and, later on, would find a way to return the ring to the rabbit.
Feeling more relaxed, the stork flew off to meet up with the rabbit, not realising that she wouldn’t be able to fly with so much weight attached to her feet. As soon as she left her nest, she began to fall like a heavy stone and could do nothing to stop herself from crashing to the ground.
However, she didn’t land on the ground. Instead, she landed on the poor rabbit, who had no time to get out of the way.
Ambulances, police, doctors and hundreds of animals rushed to the scene and asked the stork how she had come to fall on the rabbit. When they found the bandages, the lead, the paint and the ring, they all thought the fall was the final part of the storks’ cruel plan to ruin the rabbit’s wedding. In one single morning, the stork had become the most hated animal in the whole forest and lost all her friends.

Only after a long time did the rabbit dare visit the stork and he still couldn’t understand why she had insisted on ruining his wedding. Full of remorse, the stork begged the rabbit for forgiveness and told him the story of the ring and everything that had happened afterwards.
“I would never have imagined that all this could happen just because you tried the ring on without permission”, said the rabbit laughing.
“It wasn’t even because of that” the embarrassed stork replied. “It was everything I had to do to hide the ring over and over again. You wouldn’t have been as annoyed if you had found me trying it on and had to help me take it off.”
Seeing that the stork had learned her lesson by being honest, the rabbit publicly forgave her so she could get her friends back and tell her story, which helped everyone understand that the truly worst thing about telling little lies are the bigger lies that have to be invented to cover them up.

Lies in the Stone Age,,Honesty,"
Once upon a time there was a boy who was just far too naughty. One day, he was playing with a dinosaur egg, and accidentally dropped it down a ravine. When Daddy dinosaur came looking for the egg, the boy told him someone had stolen it from him and had ran far off in a certain direction. The dinosaur went off in search of the thief.

Meanwhile, at the bottom of the ravine, the dinosaur egg hatched and the baby dinosaur emerged. It had an awful time being stuck down there on its own, and wouldn't stop crying.

Days later, when the father finally found it, the baby dinosaur told his father that all the time he had heard the boy's voice. The dinosaur was furious, and went to ask the boy again what happened. Again the boy lied.
As a punishment for this, the dinosaur put the boy in his cave and blocked the entrance with a load of rocks. There the boy stayed for several days, until he had learnt his lesson.
After that he ended up being a very truthful boy, and inseparable friends with the baby dinosaur."
The boy who almost became a Prince,,Patience,"A King who had no children announced a competition to decide who would be made a Prince and heir to the throne. The boy who passed all the tests, although excellent, was impatient, and that worried the King. So the King decided to test the boy, taking him to the forest with a dog, and pointing him to a great treasure in the centre of the woods.

The King left the boy with the dog, saying that if, upon his return, the boy and the treasures were still there, waiting for him, then the boy would receive the Kingdom. The boy accepted the challenge, but soon he grew impatient, and despite the dog's warnings, the boy entered into the forest. As soon as he did so, the treasure disappeared.

And so, the boy lost both the treasure and the chance to inherit the Kingdom."
A cow in the cafe,,Patience,"Bobby Buns was a very amusing and lively waiter who had his own cafe. He was also very fortunate, because during a visit to his parents' village he discovered that one of the young cows in the latest herd was pretty special. Instead of producing milk, this cow produced milk coffee.

Intending to make himself rich, Bobby took the cow straight to the city. When he arrived, Bobby's wife told him that first he would have to reorganise the cafe so they had a place to put the cow. Bobby was so excited and impatient that he ignored this advice, and took the cow straight to the cafe.

The result was quite spectacular. The cow was featured in the newspapers and on TV. Customers came from far and wide to taste the delicious fresh milk coffee.

However, after this initial buzz of excitement, it turned out that having a cow in the middle of a cafe was not at all comfortable. Every day the cow broke twenty or thirty cups simply by swishing its tail. The cafe smelt like a stable. The hay the cow ate got spread all over the place, and the cow left so little room in the cafe that there would always be someone getting too close and stepping in a cow pat...

And so the cafe began to lose customers. To top it all, the authorities came to do an inspection. They imposed such a heavy fine that Bobby almost had to close the place. And so it was, that Bobby Buns realised that he had to be more patient and organised. He should wait until everything was ready before serving his freshly milked milk coffees.

However, Bobby was a lucky sort of chap. While the cafe was being reorganised, he took the cow back to the village. There he discovered that one of the new hens laid chocolate eggs. This time he knew he had to be patient, and wait until everything was prepared, so he could have a cafe with a cow, a chicken, milk coffee, chocolate eggs, and buns.

When this was all in place, his cafe became the most famous and successful in the whole city."
A tiny drop of magic,,Patience,"There were once two young wizard apprentices called IPlant and IEat, who trained for years to go and charge their wands in the mysterious fountain of magic. When they were finally ready, they travelled by sea to the island of A Thousand Deserts, crossed its endless sand dunes, climbed the great rock mountain and finally found the fountain. 

But the fountain was dry. So dry that they could only fill their wands with a tiny drop of magic. And when the magic of the fountain was drained, the island was transformed into an immense desert that no one could cross. Only two small oases remained and, to give themselves the best chance at survival, IPlant and IEat decided to go their separate ways, each to their own tiny oasis.

Life then became very hard for both of them. Although the oasis provided them with plenty of water, their only food were the dates from the few palm trees that had grown at the water’s edge. Although they waved their wands in an attempt to obtain food, they had so little magic that nothing ever happened.

Several weeks later, however, IEat waved his wand and a huge, tasty tomato appeared before him.

“Lucky me! If I eat it now, it will make me happy today.”

And that day was IEat's best since he had gone to live in the oasis.

A few days later, something similar happened to IPlant, when his wand produced a small potato.

“Lucky me! If I plant the potato and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.”

That day, IPlant was just as hungry as before but he also had to work to prepare the soil and plant the potato. Sometime later the wand gave IEat a chubby songbird.

“Lucky me! If I eat it now, it will make me happy today.” 

The bird tasted so good that the day turned out to be his best in the oasis. Around that time also, IPlant’s wand gave him a skinny songbird.

“Lucky me! If I feed the bird and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.”

For many days after that, IPlant shared the little food he had with the bird, to get the bird to return and wake him up every morning with beautiful songs.

Every now and again, the two wizards received new little gifts from their wands. IEat used them at once to enjoy a special day, while IPlant put up with hunger and tiredness to turn each gift into something that might be useful in future. That way, it didn’t take him long to grow a small garden with fruit, which he shared with more and more animals who provided him with assistance, food and company. Eventually he felt so happy and comfortable, and had so many things, that he finally dared to go out and find IEat to try and cross the desert and escape.

However, IEat wanted nothing to do with him. Hearing how IPlant had achieved so much and thinking that he could have done the same, he was filled with anger and jealousy. Convinced that everything was because of the little magic in his own wand, he switched it with IPlant’s when he wasn’t looking. Impatient to try his new wand, he ordered his old friend to leave. But the wand had even less magic than the one he already had, and the jealous and impatient magician was stuck in his oasis for years and years, unable to escape.

IPlant left IEat’s oasis determined to cross the desert. He had only been travelling for a few hours when a strong gust wind dragged his friend, the little bird, away. The wizard ran after him to save him, but the wind turned into a tornado that lifted the little bird, the wizard and all his things, up into the air. They flew and flew for so many hours that they crossed the desert and then crossed the sea. Finally, the wind dropped and IPlant landed softly in a peaceful green valley, next to a beautiful fountain. The bird then took Iplant’s wand in his beak and carried it to the fountain.

The young wizard felt the wand and himself fill with the purest magic and the deepest wisdom. He realised that this was the true fountain of magic and that the bird was its faithful guardian, entrusted with the job of saving such great powers for wizards who had sufficient wisdom, patience and willpower to achieve big things with just a tiny drop of magic."
The frog prince,,Patience,"Once upon a time, a mighty king lived in a palace in the shadow of a dark, mysterious forest. He had only one child, a beautiful little girl with long, owing hair, and her favorite plaything was a bright golden ball that looked just like the sun in the sky. Day after day, she would run and skip under the shadow of the huge forest trees, tossing and bouncing her ball to amuse herself. She liked to pretend that her ball was indeed the sun and that the whole wide world was hers to play with.

One day, however, as she spun the ball in her little hands, it slipped from her fingers, rolled over the leafy ground, and fell— splash!—into a deep well. She ran quickly to the edge of the well and peered in, but her beautiful golden toy had vanished into darkness.

She began to cry loudly, because she was not used to disappointment, when she suddenly heard a timid, scratchy voice behind her say, “What is the matter, princess?”
Spinning around, she realized that the speaker was the ickiest frog she had ever seen. “I have dropped my ball into the well, and it is lost forever!” she wailed.
The frog looked at her and blinked. “I could get it for you, if . . .”
“Oh, froggy! I’d give you anything you want if you could get my lovely ball back! You could have my crown!”
“I do not want a crown,” the frog said.
“Or all my jewels!” she offered.
“What would a frog do with jewels?” he wondered.
“I do not care!” the princess snapped. “Just get my ball!”


“Well,” the frog said, “I do not want jewels, but I do want a friend. It is a lonely life being an icky frog. If I fetch your ball from the dark, chilly well for you, will you agree to be my friend forever afterward, and love me, and help me?”

“Of course!” the princess promised. But in her heart, she thought, “Who cares what that old frog wants? He’ll never leave this well anyway.”

The frog did not know her thoughts, however, and he dived eagerly down into the well. A few seconds later, he emerged from the water holding the precious golden ball between two slimy webbed hands. 


“Hurray!” she cried, and seizing the ball, she immediately ran back to the palace. The frog croaked after her, “Wait! I cannot run as fast as you!” She ignored him, however, and considered the matter settled.

That night, however, while the court feasted, a loud knock sounded on the door. 9 The princess loved visitors, so she ran to open the door, but who should stand on the palace stairs but the icky, warty frog! She slammed the door in his face and ran back to her delicious dinner on her golden plate. Behind the heavy wood door, though, she could hear him croaking: “O careful, careful, princess fair! Promises are more than air!”


“Who was at the door, my daughter?” asked the king.
“Nobody! Just an old frog,” she said, and she told him how the frog had retrieved her ball from the well on the condition that she would be its friend and share everything she had with it forever afterward. She thought her father would be pleased with how she had escaped the frog’s demands, but, to her surprise, he frowned.

The princess was shocked and wanted to refuse, but she could see from her father’s stern looks that she had to obey.

Unwillingly, she got up and opened the door. The frog was still sitting patiently on the steps of the palace. When he saw the princess, he smiled happily—a smiling frog is quite a sight to behold—and bounced up and down with froggy glee.


Unwillingly, the princess allowed the frog into the magnificent palace. He bounced up and down, as frogs will when they are very happy, but she only glared at him dreadfully. She thought to herself, “Why should I have to keep my promise to this old croaker just because he fetched my ball from the well?” Her father insisted, however, that she should be his friend just as she said she would.

The frog hopped after her into the great dining hall—boing! boing!—and immediately jumped onto the table.

“So, princess,” he said, “we shall be the best of friends now.” With a contented croak, he began to eat from her shining gold plate and sparkling silver bowl. Frogs do not eat very neatly, I’m afraid, and the princess, noticing how he smeared the food all over his face, turned away in disgust. She refused to look at the frog or speak to him, but she still felt sick just thinking of such an ugly creature eating with her.


“What a lovely golden plate,” the frog remarked. “It reminds me of your ball. You have such beautiful possessions, princess. It must be nice to be a princess and have everything you want.”
“If I had everything I wanted,” the princess retorted, “you would not be eating with me.”


The frog sighed and continued eating, but soon he began to look sleepy. “I’m tired, princess,” he said. “Will you take me up to bed?”
“I could never have such a slimy frog in my bed!” the princess burst out.

Her father was about to scold her, but the frog beat him to it:
“O careful, careful, princess fair! Promises are more than air.”

What could the princess do? She had promised. So she ran up the stairs to her bedroom, and all the way up she could hear the frog hopping behind her—boing! boing!


She opened the door to her bedroom. The beautiful princess and the ugly frog stood in the doorway looking at the princess’s lovely room.

The princess left the frog at the door and climbed into her beautiful bed. She wished the frog would go away, but he sat on the floor looking up at her.

“I want to sleep on your pillow,” the frog said decidedly.
The princess shook her head. “No! Please! You can sleep anywhere you want, just not on my bed. Please! you will leave slime on the pillow.”

“I want the pillow,” the frog insisted. “You promised you would share everything with me!”
The princess pleaded and cried, but nothing could change the frog’s mind.

“You promised,” he said, “and promises are more than air.”
Finally, she had to give in. Frustrated, she climbed back into bed herself.


She tried to keep as far away from her new friend as possible. “I wish you’d just go away,” she hissed into the darkness.
The frog was silent for a long minute, and then he whispered, “Princess? There’s one more thing.”

The princess groaned. “Could I have a good-night kiss? I have been a very lonely frog.
And you did promise you would love and care for me.”
The princess was so exhausted that she did not even bother to argue. In the dark, she rolled over and planted one kiss on the top of the frog’s cold, wet head. “Now, please go to sleep,” she begged.
“Good night,” croaked the frog.
The next morning, the princess woke to find the frog still snoring on the pillow. 

She began to feel impatient for him to wake up, for she found that, gross as he was, she was lonely without him. Finally, she poked him hard with her finger. “Get up, you lazy toad!” she said.
The frog did not stir, so with the palm of her hand, she gave him a rough shove that sent him sliding off the pillow and onto the cold, stone oor of her bedroom. The moment his little webbed feet touched the ground, however, the warty frog disappeared, and in his place sat a little prince, rubbing his eyes sleepily and smiling up at the princess.
“Hello, princess! Thank you so much for keeping your promise.”
“Who are you?” she asked, very much surprised.
“Why, I’m the frog,” he responded. “A wicked witch living in the forest turned me into an ugly frog, and only you could save me. I knew that your heart was just as golden as your plate and your ball—and I was right!


Now I am free of her spell!” He looked at her. “Thank you, princess. Now I will leave you alone and go back to my home on the other side of the forest.”
“Wait!” said the princess. “I thought we were supposed to be friends forever after. And promises are more than air, you know.”
The prince laughed. “So they are. Shall we go play with your ball?”
And together they ran down the stairs and out into the bright golden sunshine. They were friends forever afterward, and when they were quite grown up, they were married with great celebration and joy.
They lived happily ever after, of course, and the princess was always glad that she had kept her promise.

Unwillingly, she got up and opened the door. The frog was still sitting patiently on the steps of the palace. When he saw the princess, he smiled happily—a smiling frog is quite a sight to behold—and bounced up and down with froggy glee.


Unwillingly, the princess allowed the frog into the magnificent palace. He bounced up and down, as frogs will when they are very happy, but she only glared at him dreadfully. She thought to herself, “Why should I have to keep my promise to this old croaker just because he fetched my ball from the well?” Her father insisted, however, that she should be his friend just as she said she would.

The frog hopped after her into the great dining hall—boing! boing!—and immediately jumped onto the table.

“So, princess,” he said, “we shall be the best of friends now.” With a contented croak, he began to eat from her shining gold plate and sparkling silver bowl. Frogs do not eat very neatly, I’m afraid, and the princess, noticing how he smeared the food all over his face, turned away in disgust. She refused to look at the frog or speak to him, but she still felt sick just thinking of such an ugly creature eating with her.


“What a lovely golden plate,” the frog remarked. “It reminds me of your ball. You have such beautiful possessions, princess. It must be nice to be a princess and have everything you want.”
“If I had everything I wanted,” the princess retorted, “you would not be eating with me.”


The frog sighed and continued eating, but soon he began to look sleepy. “I’m tired, princess,” he said. “Will you take me up to bed?”
“I could never have such a slimy frog in my bed!” the princess burst out.

Her father was about to scold her, but the frog beat him to it:
“O careful, careful, princess fair! Promises are more than air.”

What could the princess do? She had promised. So she ran up the stairs to her bedroom, and all the way up she could hear the frog hopping behind her—boing! boing!


She opened the door to her bedroom. The beautiful princess and the ugly frog stood in the doorway looking at the princess’s lovely room.

The princess left the frog at the door and climbed into her beautiful bed. She wished the frog would go away, but he sat on the floor looking up at her.

“I want to sleep on your pillow,” the frog said decidedly.
The princess shook her head. “No! Please! You can sleep anywhere you want, just not on my bed. Please! you will leave slime on the pillow.”

“I want the pillow,” the frog insisted. “You promised you would share everything with me!”
The princess pleaded and cried, but nothing could change the frog’s mind.

“You promised,” he said, “and promises are more than air.”
Finally, she had to give in. Frustrated, she climbed back into bed herself.


She tried to keep as far away from her new friend as possible. “I wish you’d just go away,” she hissed into the darkness.
The frog was silent for a long minute, and then he whispered, “Princess? There’s one more thing.”

The princess groaned. “Could I have a good-night kiss? I have been a very lonely frog.
And you did promise you would love and care for me.”
The princess was so exhausted that she did not even bother to argue. In the dark, she rolled over and planted one kiss on the top of the frog’s cold, wet head. “Now, please go to sleep,” she begged.
“Good night,” croaked the frog.
The next morning, the princess woke to find the frog still snoring on the pillow. 

She began to feel impatient for him to wake up, for she found that, gross as he was, she was lonely without him. Finally, she poked him hard with her finger. “Get up, you lazy toad!” she said.
The frog did not stir, so with the palm of her hand, she gave him a rough shove that sent him sliding off the pillow and onto the cold, stone oor of her bedroom. The moment his little webbed feet touched the ground, however, the warty frog disappeared, and in his place sat a little prince, rubbing his eyes sleepily and smiling up at the princess.
“Hello, princess! Thank you so much for keeping your promise.”
“Who are you?” she asked, very much surprised.
“Why, I’m the frog,” he responded. “A wicked witch living in the forest turned me into an ugly frog, and only you could save me. I knew that your heart was just as golden as your plate and your ball—and I was right!


Now I am free of her spell!” He looked at her. “Thank you, princess. Now I will leave you alone and go back to my home on the other side of the forest.”
“Wait!” said the princess. “I thought we were supposed to be friends forever after. And promises are more than air, you know.”
The prince laughed. “So they are. Shall we go play with your ball?”
And together they ran down the stairs and out into the bright golden sunshine. They were friends forever afterward, and when they were quite grown up, they were married with great celebration and joy.
They lived happily ever after, of course, and the princess was always glad that she had kept her promise.

-THE END-"
GINGER THE GIRAFFE,,Brave,"Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Ginger. Like all giraffes, Ginger had a long neck and long legs. Because she was so tall, she was able to eat food from the very tops of the trees in the savannah.  

One day, Ginger was busy eating her favorite leaves along with some other giraffes. It had not rained for a long time, so the grass was very dry. She heard a noise down at the bottom of her extra long legs: it was her friend, Mickey the Monkey. Mickey was trying to say something, but Ginger couldn’t understand what he was saying. He looked very tired. “What’s wrong?” asked Ginger. Ginger was a very kind giraffe who cared and wanted to help everyone.
Just then Mickey fell over!

Ginger was also a smart giraffe. She knew what was wrong. Mickey couldn’t find anything to eat and he was very hungry. Ginger nibbled some fresh, tender leaves and buds from the top of the tree where she was eating. She dropped some of the leaves and buds to the ground near where Mickey was. Then she nudged him a little with the hoof at the bottom of one of her very long legs. “Wake up, Mickey!” said Ginger.
“I’ve found something for you to eat.”
Slowly Mickey sat up and ate a little.

After a while, when Mickey was feeling better, Ginger asked him, “What’s happened, Mickey? Why are you so hungry? Why can’t you find anything to eat?” Mickey said, “It hasn’t rained for so long and now there’s no more food.” “That’s not good,” said Ginger. “What’s happening with the other animals?” “No one knows what to do,” answered Mickey. “All the zebras and the antelopes and the elephants are getting worried about the dry grass.
Some of them are thinking about leaving the savannah and trying to reach the jungle.”
“That’s a long trip,” said Ginger.
“Are you going to go with them?”

“I don’t know,” answered Mickey. “What do you think we should do?” Ginger thought for a while and then suddenly, she had a good idea. “We should go talk to Leo the Lion.
He is the smartest animal in the savannah!” Mickey was too tired to walk, so Ginger invited him to ride on her back. She was determined to find a solution. “Hold on tight to my neck,” said Ginger. “There’s a lot to hold on to,” joked Mickey. Ginger laughed. “You’re right. I’ve got the longest neck in Africa!” So they started their journey across to the other side of the savannah to look for Leo.

Ginger and Mickey were in luck!  Leo was sitting up on a rock and he was really easy to see as they walked through the grass.  “Hi, Leo!” they both shouted.  Leo had been napping and was a little grumpy when they woke him up.  But he was polite and said, “Hello Ginger and Mickey.  Why did you walk the whole way across the savannah?  Just to wake me up?”  But he was joking; he had a smile on his face.  “Mickey says that there is no food left on the savannah because it’s been so dry,” said Ginger.  “Do you have any ideas?”

Leo thought for a while. He said, “There’s nothing we can do about the rain. It will come soon, but we can’t be sure when it will arrive. When the rain comes, all the plants will grow again and there will be lots of food for everybody.”
He thought a little longer. “The only thing I can think of is for everyone to move closer to the forest,” he continued. “There will be more things to eat there, but I know it’s a long trip and it will not be very easy.
It might take days to get there.”

Ginger and Mickey looked at each other and then looked back at Leo. “Thank you, Leo,” said Ginger. “It’s probably best if they all try to get closer to the jungle.” They said goodbye and then walked back across the savannah.
Now they needed to gather all of the animals together to start the long journey. Ginger didn’t need to go along because she had plenty of food in her high trees. But she was a good friend and wanted to help as much as she could. Ginger cared a lot for her friends, they all loved eachother.
They walked towards her favorite trees and guess what she and Mickey saw?

All of the animals were already gathered there and waiting for Ginger and Mickey! “Why are you all here?” asked Ginger. “Eddie the Eagle told us that you’re taking us to the edge of the jungle,” said one of the zebras. “How did he know?” asked Mickey. “He heard you talking with Leo,” said one of the antelopes. “So you’ve all decided to try to walk together to the jungle?” asked Ginger. “Yes,” they all answered. “If you’ll help us to get there,” added one of the elephants.
“Of course, I’ll help,” said Ginger. “I’m your friend.”

So they started on their big journey across the savannah to the jungle. The sun was so hot and there was no food and no place to get a drink of water. And then they heard it. It was thunder! “Thunder!” they all shouted. Thunder was very scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you guess why? Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire. Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly what happened. “Fire!” they shouted. They
could smell it. And now they could see it.
The fire was coming towards them!

Ginger had to think fast. Because she was so tall she could see farther than any of the other animals.
She stretched her long neck up as far
as she could. Now she could see a place where there was no fire. “Quick!” she said. “Everyone run this way.”
All of the animals followed her
and ran as fast as they could. Soon, they were
out of danger. They stopped and gathered together one more time. “Is everyone here?” Ginger asked. She wanted to make sure they were all safe.
All the animals looked around; they were all there. Ginger breathed a sigh of relief after fearlessly saving her friends.

And then the most wonderful thing happened. “I felt a drop,” said a zebra. “Me too,” said an antelope. It was rain! Finally! Everyone was very happy. It started to rain a little more and then a little more. The rain put out the fire so they didn’t have to run. And the rain filled their watering holes and made the plants grow again,
so they didn’t have to make that long trip to the edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have enough food and water. So Ginger, the courageous giraffe went back to her favorite tree and continued to munch on the leaves and buds."

JESSIE THE RABBIT,,Brave,"All the animals of the forest tease
Jessie the rabbit about her shy ways. But when a friend is in trouble, it is the shy Jessie who saves the day with her courage and quick thinking.

Jessie, the rabbit was eating a carrot in a green meadow, one sunny day.

He watched the other animals run around and play and he admired them. He had always been the shy one and they were always playing without him.

They made fun of him because he got startled so easily. If a tree fell somewhere in the forest, he would rush into his rabbit hole and hide for the rest of the day. ‘You’re such a scared cat, Jessie,’ Teddy, the cub once said when she passed by him. ‘You never have any fun, Jessie.’

But Jessie, the rabbit was a cautious and wise rabbit. He knew better than to ignore every sound.

“I may look stupid and scared, but I will always be prepared for danger.” thought Jessie. He would hide and curl up every time he heard a crack or saw a shadow loom over his hole. 

One fine day, just like any other, a distant crack was heard. A tree fell down and a light brightly burned. Jessie darted into his hole, while the other animals continued frolicking around. Jessie shouted as loud as he could ‘Run!’, but no one heard him. So he jumped inside his hole and curled up into a ball.

While Jessie was hiding, he could still hear the others laughing. Then all of a sudden, Jessie heard some squeals, some running and then Beaver started shouting, “The forest is on fire, the forest is on fire! Everybody run, the fire is spreading!” The Beaver continued to shout as he ran past Jessie’s hole. The whole forest was in a wild panic.


Trampling everything, the animals ran away,
leaving behind a cloud of dust and the forest on fire. Only Jessie was left in his hiding place, safe beneath the ground. Jessie had cleverly stashed away a supply of food and water in his hole. He knew that one day danger would come and he wanted to be prepared. He was relieved to know he had enough supplies to last until the fire was over.

In the distance, Jessie could hear a loud squeal “Help! Someone, help me, please.” Jessie did not want to come out of his hole, as he knew that the fire was spreading. But then he heard the squeal a second and third time. Jessie couldn’t just hide in his hole while someone was out there on his own. He decided to take matters into his own hands and was determined to help.

Jessie slowly raised his head from his hole. He could see the flaming trees all round. He heard another squeal and turned his head to see Teddy, the cub lying down with his leg caught beneath a thick, fallen branch. The ground around him was burning and the fire was getting closer.

The Jessie was very afraid but he couldn’t just leave Teddy there. Huffing and puffing, he rushed with incredible speed towards the Teddy. ‘Jessie, please, you need to find a way to get this thing off!’ said Teddy. Jessie started running around, looking for a way to help.

Jessie saw that the other side of the branch had started to burn and was becoming thinner.
Jessie had an idea and he darted down into his hole. He grabbed some of the nut casings that he had stored the water in and ran back towards Teddy.
He rushed towards the branch and poured
the water on the branch.

The branch was now thin and wobbly, but Teddy still could not get his foot free. So Jessie gathered all his strength and in a single dash smashed his body against it. A crack was heard and the branch broke into half, freeing Teddy. He slowly got up and approached Jessie.

Teddy was surprised at Jessie’s heroism and even more surprised at how he had managed to free him. He saw jessie lying down.

Jessie was looking very tired, so he picked him up in his mouth and rushed away from the fire into the cool hills nearby.

A few days later all the animals had settled into a new place in the woods, where the fire hadn’t reached. Everyone was still playing but something had changed. Teddy, the cub was taking care of Jessie, the rabbit who was still recovering.

No one laughed at Jessie anymore for he had saved their friend and they knew of his courage. From that day on, all of them followed in his footsteps and have been careful till this day.They now knew that being careful does not mean that you are not brave."
BRAVE BORA,,Brave,"Bora is sitting at the clinic with Baba. Jojo, his stufed monkey, came too. Jojo is sleeping in Bora’s bag

“I don’t like needles. They hurt!” says Bora. 

“An injection helps make you healthy. It’s okay to be afraid, Bora. Baba will be right here with you. And Jojo too.”

“Bora Baraka!” a loud voice calls. “Let’s go Bora,” says Baba. “It’s your turn.”

“Remember what Baba said you will get for being courageous enough to get your injection?” asks Baba. “A red lollipop! Okay, I’m coming,” says Bora.

The doctor smiles at Bora. “Is this your monkey? Can we examine him too?” she asks.

Bora looks at Baba, then at Jojo, and nods. 

“Now, it’s your turn,” she says. Will you help me give your monkey a small injection so he feels better?” asks the doctor.

“TOOP!” says the doctor as she gives Jojo the monkey an injection.

“Now, it’s your turn. Is that a superhero on your T-shirt?” she asks.

“TOOP!” she says as she gives Bora the injection.

“Ouch!” shouts Bora. “Hey, that wasn’t so bad!”

“I know it stings a little, but we’re done and you have been very brave!” says the doctor.
“One red lollipop for our brave Bora!” "
THE LION’S TAIL,,Brave,"In a small village there lived a boy called Leo. He was a small, slim kid, and he lived forever in fear because some boys from a neighboring village would harass poor Leo and try to have fun at his expense.


One day, a young wizard was passing by the village and saw Leo being made fun of. When the other boys left, the wizard went over to Leo and gave him a beautiful lion’s tail, along with a small tie that allowed Leo to hang the lion’s tail from his belt.
-“It’s a magic tail. When the person wearing it acts bravely, he or she will turn into a ferocious lion.”
Having seen the young wizard’s powers some days earlier during his act, Leo didn’t doubt his words, and from that time on he wore the lion’s tail hanging from his belt, hoping that the horrible kids would turn up so he could teach them a good lesson.
But when the boys came along to look for trouble once again, Leo was afraid and he tried to run away. However, they soon caught him up and surrounded him. The usual jokes and pushing started, then Leo felt the lion’s tail hanging from his belt. Then, summoning up all his courage to confront them, Leo tensed his body, made two fists, and looked up, fixedly into the eyes of each of the boys, and with all the calmness and ferocity in the World, he promised that if they didn’t leave him alone at that instant one of them - even if it were only one – would regret it for ever… today, tomorrow, and any other day. He kept looking them in the eye, with his hardest expression, ready to do what he had promised.
Leo felt goosebumps all over. This must be the sign that he was turning into a lion, because the looks on the boys’ faces were definitely changing. They all took a step back, looked at each other, and finally ran off. Leo wanted to take off after them and give them a good beating with his new body, but when he tried to move, he felt his legs were short and just normal, so he had to abandon the idea.
Not far off, the wizard observed, smiling. He ran over to Leo. Leo was very happy, though a bit disappointed that his new lion body had lasted only a short time, and he hadn’t managed to fight them.
-“You wouldn’t have been able to anyway,”
the wizard told him,
-“no one fights with lions, because simply from seeing them, and knowing how brave and ferocious they are, everyone runs away. Have you ever seen a lion fighting?""
It was true. Leo couldn’t remember ever having seen a lion fighting. Leo became filled with thought, looking at the lion’s tail. And he understood everything. There had been no magic, no transformation, no nothing. What happened was that a good friend had shown him that bullies and other cowardly animals never dare to confront a truly brave boy."
Manute the Brave,,Brave,"""The best man in the whole tribe is Manute the brave"", everyone would say. You could see for yourself, at any time of the day, just how brave he was. He would jump to the ground from amazing heights, he would fight poisonous snakes, he would catch scorpions with his bare hands, and could cut the palm of his own hand with a knife - without even a flinch. They said the exact opposite about Pontoma. No one had seen him catch even a monkey.
One day, they happened upon each other in the forest, and Manute was showing Pontoma a coral snake he had just caught, when there began a downpour, the likes of which no one had ever seen. They both ran to shelter themselves under some thick foliage, and there they stayed until the rain had stopped.
However, when they were about to leave the shelter, they heard the roar of a tiger, at a distance of only a couple of meters. The foliage was very thick and dense, and the tiger wouldn't be able to get through it to attack them. However, the tiger was almost at the entrance hole. If it happened to come in and find the two tribesmen there, they certainly wouldn't get out alive. Manute was getting restless. He wanted to get out of that tight hole, and confront the tiger in open space, where he could fully use his great hunting skills. Pontoma was gesturing at him to keep still and be quiet, but Manute, tired of being stuck with a coward, leapt out of the thicket, surprising the tiger.
The tiger suffered a couple of deep wounds, but soon recovered, and hurt Manute with two swipes of its paw, throwing him to the ground. The tiger took the initiative, and leapt upon Manute, but Manute's spear, in the hands of Pontoma, interrupted the tiger's attack. The tiger turned away, wounded, but the spear moved as fast as a beam of light, and with incredible precision, hurting the animal again and again, until it fell to the ground, lifeless.
Manute, shocked, and bleeding freely from his injuries, witnessed all this while lying flat on his back on the ground. Never before had he seen anyone take on a tiger, and use the spear with such calmness and strength, as he had seen Pontoma do just now.
Neither of them said a thing. Manute's grateful expression needed no words to be understood. Nor did they need words to know about Pontoma's wounded hand, or the fact that they were leaving a tiger skin there in the forest.
From that day on, people gradually remarked less on Manute's braveness. They thought maybe he was less courageous than before. The strangest thing was that they now noticed that Manute's old spear was among Pontoma's things.
But Manute just smiled, and remembered the day he learned that true bravery lay not in seeking out danger, but in controlling one's fear when danger crosses your path."
"Tony, the human Wasp",,Brave,"Tony set off for home again without having eaten. As usual, one of the older boys had taken his packed lunch, threatening to give him a good hiding. On his way, Tony stopped at the park and sat on a bench, trying to control his anger. As he was a sensitive and intelligent boy, before long he had managed to forget it, and was busy enjoying the plants and the flowers. He suddenly saw a wasp flying about among the rosebushes, and it gave him a bit of a fright.
While getting away from the roses, a thought came into his head. How is it that something so much smaller than himself could frighten him like that?
That was just what he needed to do himself, against the older boys!
He spent a while looking at the insects, and by the time he arrived home he had a good understanding of the wasp's trick; it was fear. A wasp could never fight a person, but everyone was so afraid of its sting that they left the wasp in peace. So Tony spent that night wondering what his 'sting' could be. He tried to think of what frightened those bigger boys.
The next day, Tony seemed like a new boy. No longer did he walk with his gaze on the ground, nor did he look away when people spoke to him. He was confident, ready to face up to and confront anyone, with his mind on his new role of frightening people, and on his back he carried a backpack full of 'stings'.
The boy who stole his packed lunch that day ate an extremely hot sausage sandwich. The sausage was so spicy that he ended up crying and coughing. Never again did he want to eat anything belonging to Tony. Another older boy wanted to hit Tony, but this time Tony didn't run away. From memory, he told him the phone numbers of his parents, his teacher, and the boy's own mother,
-""If you hit me they'll all find out, and you'll be severely punished,""
Tony told him, looking at the boy so determinedly and courageously that the boy left him alone. Another bully looking for trouble wanted to take one of Tony's toys. Instead of giving him it in fear, Tony gave the boy a small card written by a policeman he knew. It read
-""If you rob this boy I’ll come after you and I'll even lock you up.""
The tactic worked.
Just like Tony had been afraid of their beatings, those big kids too were afraid of many things. On one occasion, a bully hit him a couple of times, and Tony had to be brave and carry out his warning. The bully got such a fright that from that day he preferred to protect Tony.
So, in the end, Tony became like the wasp he'd seen. Without even having to sting anyone, he frightened them, and ensured that no one would mess with him."
The Magic Coins,,Honesty,"There was once a rich and kindly old man who, reaching the end of his days, decided to leave his possessions to some honest and intelligent young man. Speaking of this decision, he told a good friend that he wanted to choose wisely. The friend advised him,

“The next time you sell something, and are giving the customer their change, make sure you give them too much. The customer who returns the extra money to you, you will know that they are honest”.

The rich man thanked his friend for the advice, and thinking it a good idea, and easy to carry out, he decided to try it.

What he did not know was this. One of those present during the conversation – a neighbour who pretended to be his friend, but was really very envious of the rich old man – hired the services of a wizard. He paid the wizard to cast a spell on the rich old man’s coins. The spell would mean that anyone who saw coins touched by the old man, rather than seeing them as coins, would see them as that which the customer wanted most in the world.

With this plan, the envious neighbour believed that no customer would return the old man’s change, and, having no one to leave his money to, the old man would leave it all to the neighbour’s young nephew.

Indeed, everything went according to plan for the greedy neighbour, and not a single customer was able to return the enchanted coins. Some saw in these coins the biggest diamond or precious stone, others saw a work of art, some saw a relic, and some saw a miraculous healing potion. When the old man had almost given up trying to find an honest person, the greedy neighbour sent his nephew to the old man’s business, taking great care to instruct the boy to return the old man’s money. The nephew was determined to do so, but on receiving the enchanted coins he saw in them all the possessions and honours of his own uncle. Believing that what his uncle had told him was a trick, he left with his useless coins and his greed, to no end, since when his uncle learned of this betrayal, he made his nephew banish forever.

The rich old man, sick and depressed, decided to call his servants before he died. He gave them some possessions so that they could live freely when he was no longer with them. Among these servants was a youth, who received some portion of this money by mistake. The youth, raised in the house of the wise and just old man, who he loved like a father, saw, in place of the money, a powerful medicine which would cure the old man, since this was truly what he most wanted in the world. On seeing this, the youth offered the money back to the old man, saying “Take this, Sir, it’s for you; it will make you feel better.”

And the return of that simple coin indeed acted like the most miraculous of cures. The old man leapt with joy at having finally found an honest person, and it filled him with joy to find that this honest person had always been in his very own house.

And so, the young servant went on to manage, with great justice, generosity and honesty, all the old man’s possessions and business concerns. And the old man went on to accompany and advise him like a son for many more years."
Kroaker the bullfrog,,Brave,"Not long ago, in a crystal-clear river, near a small town lived two very big fish.
In fact, they were so big that they were not afraid of anything.
They swam anywhere they wanted.
They tangled the lines of children fishing in their river.
They ate when they were hungry and splashed anyone sitting on the bank.
They were the big, brave rulers of the crystal-clear river.
One day, a large bullfrog and his family moved into the area.
The bullfrog saw the two big, brave fish in the crystal-clear river and wanted to talk to them.
But he was afraid.
He didn’t know a lot about the crystal-clear river,or the big brave fish that lived there, and was afraid of being eaten.
For a long time he watched the big, brave fish, the crystal-clear river, and everything around him to make sure it was safe.
The bullfrog was very smart and used his common sense to guide him.
Then, with a mighty hop, he jumped into the crystal-clear river to introduce himself.
“I’m Kroaker, the biggest and smartest bullfrog in the world.” he said.
“Is that so?” replied one of the fish.
“We are the biggest and bravest fish in the crystal-clear river.”
The other fish looked at Kroaker and said. “If you are nice we may let you share our water.”
The three talked and over time, the two big, brave fish and Kroaker became friends.
Every day the three of them would meet at the same spot in the crystal-clear river to eat, talk, and play.
Late one evening, as the three were talking, two fishermen passed by.
Kroaker saw them, and common sense told him to hop into the water and hide under the bank.
The two big, brave fish slowly swam in circles so the fishermen could see just how big they were.
One of the fishermen saw them and said, “This crystal-clear river has some really big fish. Let’s come back tomorrow morning and catch them.”
As the fishermen turned and walked away, they discussed what type of bait might work best to catch big, brave fish.
“Worms.” said one.
“No,sausages.” said the other, and they continued their discussion as they walked the twisty path along the crystal-clear river’s edge.
The two big, brave fish and the Kroaker overheard the fishermen.
“My friends,” said Kroaker. “Did you hear what they said? You should swim away and hide.
I am afraid they may catch and eat me, so I will take my family to a nearby pond to be safe.”
The two big, brave fish bubbled out laughs as they jumped in and out of the water.
One said, “My dear bullfrog friend, do not fear.”
Kroaker looked at the two brave fish and said, “I would rather be safe than sorry.”
“From what I heard they might come back so I will leave with my family to the safety of the pond, take care.”
Kroaker left and the two big, brave fish swam to the bottom of the crystal-clear river.
The next morning, just after sunrise, the two fishermen returned to the crystal-clear river where the day before they had seen the two big, brave fish.
They walked slowly and quietly so as not to disturb them. 
“Look,” whispered one of the fishermen,“there they are.”
The fishermen gently cast their bait and let it slowly drift in the current to attract the big, brave fish. It worked!
In moments, each had hooked one of the big, brave fish.
Then the battle between the fishermen and the fish began.
The big, brave fish used all their tricks to free themselves.
They dived deep, swam fast, and leaped from the water,
thrashing their tail and head in an attempt to get free.
The battle raged for over ten minutes but in the end, the big, brave fish were no match for the fishermen.
They were caught!
Kroaker watched from the safety of the tall grass that separated the pond from the bank of the crystal-clear river.
Oh, the anglers were excited!
Each had caught a big brave fish on their first cast of the day.
What a story they had to tell when they returned home!
Kroaker carefully hopped back to the pond and told his family what he had seen.
“Both my big, brave fish friends were very talented, and still they were caught.But I, with only common sense, saved my family. It is lonely without them. I will miss them.”
“We have to learn a lesson from this,” said Kroaker to his family.
“At the first sign of danger, use common sense and act quickly and courageously to save yourself.”"

Brave rima,,Brave,"Rima went to the fair with her uncle. 
It was a Boishakhi fair! 
So many colours everywhere. 
Red, white, and all the others. Uncle especially loved red.
There were so many shops! And so many things to buy!
Rima looked at everything in wonder.
Suddenly… she didn't see her uncle.
Where did Uncle go?
He was nowhere to be seen! Rima was afraid.
But she did not lose courage.
I know how to find lost things and be brave, Rima thought.
I will explore the fair and look for Uncle!
A crowd was gathered under a tree watching the snake act.
Rima called out.
But Uncle was not there.
Maybe he is buying a doll for me! Rima thought. 
She ran to the doll shop.
Rima called out.
But Uncle was not there.
Where did Uncle go?
Perhaps he has gone to the red merry-go-round, Rima thought.
So she ran there determined to find her uncle.
Rima called out.
But Uncle was not there.
Then Rima saw a man nearby. 
He was wearing a red panjabi like Uncle's!
Rima called loudly, “UNCLE!”
The man turned to look at Rima.
“Oh, dear. Have you lost your Uncle?” he asked.
Rima saw balloons flying above a tree. Near the tree she saw a boy. 
He was all alone and he was crying.
“What happened?"" Rima asked. ""Why are you crying?”
But the boy didn’t stop. “MAAAA! BABAAAA!” he cried.
Rima knew just what to do. 
She took the boy to the closest microphone. ""This boy needs our help, "" she told the announcer. 
""Please tell his parents he is right here!""
The boy's parents arrived soon.
They were so happy. 
But where was Rima's uncle?
Wait.. is that..
“UNCLE!”
They rushed towards each other. Uncle said,
“Where have you been? I looked everywhere for you.”
“I was looking for you!"" Rima answered. 
""But Uncles shouldn't need children to look for them!”"
The green chicken,,Brave,"In the corner of the farmyard, two eggs lay on a pile of straw.
The mother hen sat on them all day and got up only to drink water and eat something in a hurry.
One day a strange big egg rolled down from the hill next to the farm, it came under the fence and stopped right next to the nest with the two eggs.
“Hey! Someone dropped their egg!” cried the hen.
“Come and take it quickly before it cools down!”
Nobody answered. There was no one on the hill.
The hen wondered what to do.
Finally she pushed the egg close to hers to keep it warm in the nest.
All three eggs hatched at the same time and the mother named them Chick, Chip and Chop.
When they went for their first walk in the yard, everyone stared at Chop.
“Hahaha ... What a funny chicken!”
“Look at his fluff! But this is not even fluff, but some scaly stuff!”
“It's all green...This is so weird!”
“Urgh... disgusting…”
Although he was a strange chicken, Chop was very determined.
He tried his best to do everything his brothers did - dig for worms, flap his wings, squeak in a gruff voice.
Chick and Chip tried to help him, but it just didn't work.
All the animals on the farm chased and mocked him.
The worst was the rooster, who constantly bit and insulted him.
“What an ugly and incompetent chicken...a disgrace to the farm. He is completely worthless!”
No one was playing or talking to him except his brothers and his mother.
In the evening, after everyone fell asleep, Chop would go out into the yard, look at the sky and wish on every shooting star he could become a normal chicken.
One night a fox sneaked into the farm and grabbed Chick and Chip.
Everyone panicked... feathers scattered everywhere.
""Help!"" Chick and Chip, afraid, started shouting. 
Their mother rushed
to save them, but the fox grabbed her by the throat.
All the hens and chickens clumped together in the corner of the coop, and the fox blocked the way out.
""So ... three so far,"" the fox smiled smugly. 
""I need one more because I am expecting guests tomorrow. Any volunteers?”
""Take whoever you want,"" said the rooster cowardly, ""but it's best to get some little chicken with tender meat. You won’t want me, I am very chewy.”
""Okay ... I'm going to get ... I'm going to get…"" the fox began to wonder.
At that moment the fox heard something behind him. It was Chop: “Let them go!”
“Aaaaaaa!” cried the fox and dropped his prey. “Noooo… My tail!”
“You want one more chicken? Here I am!” Chop gritted his teeth.
“I changed my mind!” said the fox. “I don't want chickens anymore. Please let me go. It is so painful…”
""I don’t want to see you ever again!"" Chop said, still biting the fox’s tail.
""I promise! I will not set foot here again. Just let me go.”
Chop opened his mouth and the fox ran away.
Chick, Chip and their mother rose from the ground, still frightened but unharmed.
""Wow... That was amazing!"" Chip shouted, catching his breath. ""You looked so cool confronting him!""
""Chop, you're the bravest and the most courageous chicken in the world!"" said Chick and hugged him.
When Chop went out into the yard the next morning, all the chickens gathered around him.
“We will go and play football with the ducks. Do you want to come?”
“Well, I've never played football before... I'll just get in the way” said Chop.
“No problem. We will teach you. It's much easier than fighting a fox.”
""Ok, I'll come."" Chop smiled, and for the first time he felt like a real chicken."
The Cave of Fear,,Brave,"There was once a town where the thing everyone feared the most was getting lost at night in the dangerous ""Cave of Fear"". No one had ever returned from there, and whenever anyone got lost and ended up there, the last that was heard was a great cry of terror, followed by a few enormous guffaws. The townsfolk lived in terror that one day the monster would leave the cave. So they regularly left gifts and food at the mouth of the cave, and these always soon disappeared.

One day, a young brave man came to town, and, as he heard about the situation with the cave, he thought that it was unfair. So he decided to enter the cave and confront the monster. The young man asked for some help, but everyone was so afraid that not a single person approached the mouth of the cave with him. He went inside, finding his way with a torch, and calling out to the monster, wanting to talk with it and discuss the situation. At first, the monster had a good long laugh, and the young man followed the sound of the monster's voice. But then the monster went quiet,and the young man had to carry on, not knowing in which direction to go.

Finally he arrived at a huge cavern. At the bottom of the cavern he thought he could make out the figure of the monster, and as he approached it, he felt that something hit him hard on his back. This pushed him forward towards a hole in the rock. He couldn't avoid it, and fell through. Believing that he was about to die, he let out one last cry. Then he heard the great guffaws. 

-""Darn it, I think the monster has swallowed me,"" 

he said, whilst falling.

However, as he fell, he heard music, and voices. They got clearer, and when he made a soft landing at the bottom, he heard a group of people shout: 

-""Surprise!!""

Hardly believing it, he found himself right in the middle of a big party. The partygoers were all those people who had never returned to the town. They explained to him that this place had been the idea of an old mayor of the town. That mayor had tried to accomplish great things, but was always held back by the fears of the people around him. So the mayor invented the story of the monster to demonstrate to people how such an attitude was so limiting. So the young man stayed there, enjoying the party and the company of all those who had dared to approach the cave.

And what about the town? In the town they still believe that to enter the Cave of Fear is the worst of all punishments..."
The Respectful Prince and the Dwarves,,Respect,"Once upon a time, the King's two Princes were playing in a forest, and - meeting one at a time -, they came across four dwarves who asked them to be more careful.

The first dwarf had a headache and he asked them not to shout. The second dwarf was painting a landscape, and he asked the children to move away because they were blocking out the light. The third dwarf was doing a giant jigsaw puzzle in the middle of the road, and he asked the children not to tread on it. The fourth dwarf was watching a butterfly and he asked them not to frighten it away.

The Prince who respected others did as the dwarves asked, but the disrespectful Prince ignored the dwarves´ pleas, and kept bothering them. In the evening, both boys had become separated and lost. They needed to get back to the palace quickly.

Each of them separately came across the four dwarves again, and asked for their help. They refused to help the disrespectful Prince, but with the respectful Prince they did whatever they could to help, and took him along some secret tracks which led right to the palace.

The other Prince arrived much later, and was punished for it by his family. He now understood that it's much better to respect and care for everyone's needs if you want to have friends."
The Boy Who Always Won,,Honesty,"There was once a boy who liked nothing more in the world than to win. He loved winning at whatever it may be: football, cards, video games... everything. And because he couldn't stand losing, he had become an expert in all kinds of tricks and cheating. He could play tricks in practically every situation, without being noticed; even in video games or playing alone. He could win without ever being caught.

He won so many times that everyone saw him as the champion. It meant that almost no one wanted to play with him, he was just too far ahead of everyone. One person who did play with him was a poor boy, who was a bit younger. The champion really enjoyed himself at the poor boy's expense, always making the boy look ridiculous.

But the champion ended up getting bored with all this. He needed something more, so he decided to apply for the national video games championship, where he would find some competitors worthy of himself. At the championship he was keen to show his skills but, when he tried using all those tricks and cheats he knew from a thousand different games, well... none of them worked. The competition judges had prevented any of the tricks from working.

He felt terribly embarrassed: he was a good player, but without his cheats, he couldn't beat a single competitor. He was soon eliminated, and sat there, sad and pensive. Finally, they announced the name of the tournament champion. It was the poor boy from home. The one he had always beaten!
Our boy realised that the poor boy had been much cleverer than himself. It hadn't mattered to the poor boy if he lost and got a good beating, because what he was really doing was learning from each of his defeats. And from so much learning he had been transformed into a real master.

From then on, the boy who had loved winning gave up wanting to win all the time because he realized he could be a good player if he acted honestly without cheating. He was quite happy to lose sometimes, because that was when he would learn how to win on the really important occasions."

Anna's story,,Respect,"There was a girl called Anna, who was studying in Esmarth Vil, a primary school in the United States.

She was the most hardworking girl at her school, her marks were higher than the others. She was the best, but nobody wanted to be her friend. They didn´t want to play with her and teased her.

One day, the teacher set an exam and a boy called Robert signed his exam using Ana´s name. So, when the teacher returned all the exams, everybody was shocked. Anna found out she had failed the exam, and the other kids were happy of this.

 
The next day, when Anna arrived at school all the kids wanted to be with her and invited her to play with them. Suddenly, when Anna was playing with the other children,the teacher appeared to inform her that there had been a mistake, and she hadn´t failed.

The teacher explained them what had happened and afterwould, they all stopped playing with Anna.

One day, the First Lady of the United States went to visit the school. She wanted to visit every child in every schools. During her visit, the First Lady saw that Anna was crying and so she said:

– “What is your name?”

The girl answered: “Anna”

And the First Lady asked her why was she crying, Anna explained what had happened. She told her how she was lonely and how the other kids didn’t like her just because she was the most hardworking at the school and she always got good results.

Then, the First Lady took the school microphone and told stories about her childhood that were similar to Anna´s.

After her speech all the children realized that they had been rude to Anna, and felt sorry. They should have been happy to have a friend that got such good marks and made such a big effort at school.

Then they followed Anna’s example and their marks began to improve with Anna's help and they always played together without ignoring her or anyone else.

From then on they were very happy and learned the lesson to respect and care for others.

The Gossips,,Respect,"Sarah and Mark were a pair of champion gossips. They were always spying, and poking their noses into anything and everything. And how they loved to broadcast what they had discovered - which was a lot, and very little of it good. People had often explained to them the importance of respecting others' privacy, but they would just reply, ""If they had nothing to hide then they wouldn't mind. We have nothing to hide, so we couldn't care less.""

Then, one day, a poor, bad-tempered wizard with very few powers, crossed their path. Sarah and Mark managed to break one of the wizard's tricks, so the wizard decided to get his revenge by using a strange spell which would give all the children a good laugh, before he moved on. The next day, when Sarah and Mark were sitting in class, the emergency speaker came on. It was the wizard's voice. He said,

""Ding dong dinnnng! Ding dong dinnnng! Attention! Sarah Jones thinks Robert is very good-looking, and she'd like to be his girlfriend. Ding dong dinnnng!”

How embarrassed Sarah felt! She hadn't told anyone how she felt about Robert, and she turned as red as a ripe tomato. There was quite a commotion in class, and the noise only subsided when the speaker came on again: 

""Attention! Right now, Mark Smith is thinking that Anthony Wilson is a fat and rather foolish gorilla, and that if he - Smith - were a bit bigger, he'd give Wilson a seriously good beating. Ding dong dinnnng!""

Mark dearly wanted to run out of the classroom to hide.

And so it went. Throughout the day the speaker would come on and reveal the innermost thoughts of our two little gossips. With every passing minute their trouble and embarrassment were mounting. So much so, that eventually the two of them went over to the speaker, crying with anger, and demanding that the voice stop reporting their thoughts.

""If you have nothing to hide then it shouldn't bother you,"" answered the wizard.

""Of course we have nothing to hide!"" they answered, ""but those are private thoughts!"" And their complaints continued.

After a while the complaints petered out, and Sarah and Mark looked at each other. They had finally realised that what the wizard was now doing was exactly what they themselves had been doing all their lives. After they promised not to gossip any more about other people's private lives, the wizard removed the spell and said goodbye to them all.

And every child in that class long remembered that hilarious morning at school, where they were given a most effective lesson on the importance of respecting others' privacy."
Pillars of the Earth,,Respect,"There was once a boy who always treated his mother horribly, shouting at her, insulting her. It didn't matter to him how sad he made her.

One day, without knowing how, he woke up in an immense and lonely place. He was sitting on a rock from which four huge pillars rose up into the sky, appearing to support the entire world.

He was all alone, but soon an enormous flock of crows with beaks made of steel landed on the rock, and set about violently chipping away at it.

After the crows left, a mysterious door in one of the pillars opened, and through it came a charming and pretty girl.

-""Have you come to help us? That's great! We need all the people we can get.""

The boy was puzzled, and spotting his confusion, the little girl explained.

-""So you don't know where you are? This is the centre of the Earth. These pillars support the whole planet, and this rock keeps the pillars in place.""

-""And how can I help you?"" 

said the boy, confused.

-""Well, to help look after the rock, of course. Anyone can see by your face that you're the best person for the job,"" 

answered the girl, 

-""The birds you saw are only increasing in number, and if we don't look after this rock it will eventually crumble and everything will come crashing down.”

-""And what do you see in my face?!"" 

exclaimed the boy, surprised. 

-""I've never looked after a rock in my whole life!""

-""But you'll learn how, even if you've never done it. Here, look in this mirror,"" 

said the girl, holding one in front of the boy's face.

The boy could clearly see he now had the face of a bird, and his nose was gradually turning into steel. There he stood, shocked and worried, not a word passing his lips.

-""All those crows used to be children like you and I, "" 

explained the girl, 

-""but they decided not to look after the rock. Now that they're older they've turned into evil birds; all they do is destroy. Up to now, you haven't done much to look after it, but now that you know, will you help me to preserve all this?"" 

She said all this with a smile, taking his hand in hers.

The boy still didn't quite understand all this. He looked closely at the pillars and could see that each one was made of thousands and thousands of little figurines, representing the best virtues: sincerity, effort, generosity...

Closely inspecting the ground beneath him, he could see that the enormous rock was made up of little instances of children showing respect to their mothers, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and old people.

What the crows were trying to do was cover over these instances by carving out scenes of shouting and insults. Next to his feet, he could see his own little carving, representing the last time he shouted at his mother. That image, in such a strange place, made him realise that the only thing keeping the columns standing was respect. Respect was sustaining the world.

The boy, filled with regret, stayed there and looked after the rock for many days. He carried out his task joyfully, going without sleep to repel every crow attack. He carried on until, exhausted by his efforts, he collapsed; completely spent.

When he woke he was back in his bed at home, and he didn't know whether it had all been a dream. However, what he was now sure of was that no crow would ever again get the chance to carve a picture of him shouting at his mother."
The Evil Goblins,,Respect,"Once upon a time, there was a gang of evil goblins who lived in a forest. They spent a lot of their time making fun of a poor old man who could now hardly move, see, or hear. They showed no respect for his age. 

The situation became so extreme that the Great Wizard decided to teach the goblins a lesson. He cast a spell, and from that moment, every insult they directed at the old man made the old man better, but had the opposite effect on the goblin who was doing the insulting. Of course, the goblins knew nothing about what was happening. The more they called the man an ""old fool"", the younger and sharper of mind he became, while the goblin who had shouted at him aged rapidly, and became a little more foolish.

As time went on, those evil goblins were becoming terribly old, ugly, stupid, and clumsy... without even realising it. Finally, the Great Wizard allowed the goblins to see themselves, and, terrified, they saw that they had turned into the disgusting creatures we now know as trolls.

They had been so busy picking on the old man, that it had made them incapable of noticing that their own acts were turning them into monsters. And when they finally realised what their acts of disrespect had done, it was too late."
"Dayane, the Bad Girl",,Respect,"Once upon a time there was a naughty girl called Dayane, she was very disobedient she always argues with her mum , never obeyed her mum, and her mum wanted to teach her a lesson. She punished her every time she behaved badly, but Dayana continued the same as always and didn’t care about the consequences.

She knew it was for her own good. Her mum loved her and didn´t want anything bad to happen to her, thats why she always gave her advice.


One day, Dayane woke up very early. When her mum saw her she told her to sit on a wood chair. Dayane didn´t want to, so her mom asked her to take another chair, but the rebellious girl said:

– “No!”


The chair moved and broke and she fell over. Her mom looked at her and said, “I told you to be more respectful with your mum and  stop acting naughty”  and laughed.

“See, dear daughter, I don´t ask you to do things to torment you, I tell you to do things for your own good, because I love you so much. And I´m laughing because I warned you and you ignored me and you just continued to yell at me we will never reach an agreement . To obey is good, it is not a curse. Actually it is good, because I am showing you my love and you show me yours. If you don’t respect and obey me I won´t know if you really love me. See what I want to do if you don´t change. As you always say, you have the obligation to do what I tell you to do, and you say it´s unfair because you have the freedom of doing what you want because you are independent and you don´t like me taking you out of danger. But if I order you to do something it is for your own good. Imagine living with a rude daughter. You wouldn’t like it when you are an adult, cooking, paying expenses, working, nobody would like you if you were like that. If you keep behaving so badly,  I will help you to change to be a better person, if you do your part. We will work together to make you really happy, and I will be happy too if I see you doing well and if you become more respectful ”.

The girl´s eyes filled with tears because she knew that living far away would be difficult. She felt sorry and promised her mum she would change, and that she had deserved the punishment due to her bad behaviour with her mum .Moreover, she will be respectful of everyone. .

From that day on, daughter and mum worked on their good manners, better education and, in short, human values that she had to learn. They lived together always and were very happy."
A Child's Imagination,,Respect,"There was a boy called Mike who got along very well with the other children; Ruth Charlie and Eddy. They were all very good friends and respect and care for each other.

But one day, they had a fight. Nobody knew why this had happened because they played together every day and never had arguments.

It all started when they were trying to decide what to play. Each of them chose a different game. One of them decided to play football, another wanted to skip with a rope, and another wanted to play hide and seek.

they could not reach an agreement and so started to argue and they started to be rude to each other. One of them stopped the dispute quickly, saying:

– “don’t fight just because each of you have different ideas and  don't  be rude with each other. We can organize ourselves and play all the games. A different game every day, and then all of us will be happy“.

The kids realized that arguing was not good and were very sorry, because they were very good friends. They laughed at what had happened and played everyday as before.

They decided to invent different games every afternoon, and had so much fun using their imagination.
They never argued again, and were very happy because they respected each other."

Drums in Space,,Respect,"Brenda Bongos was a happy, artistic girl, a girl with one big ambition - to play the drums in a band. But one big obstacle lay in her way. To be good enough to play in a band Brenda had to practice a lot, but she lived next-door to a lot of old people - many of them sick - in a care home. She knew that the sound of beating drums and crashing cymbals would really get on their nerves.

Brenda was a very good, respectful, girl. She always tried to find a way of practicing her drums without bothering other people. So, she had tried playing in the strangest places; a basement, a kitchen, an attic, and even in a shower. But it was no good; there was always someone it would annoy. However, determined to practice as much as she could, Brenda spent most of her time playing on books and boxes, and looking for new places to practice.

One day, while watching a science documentary on TV, she heard that sound cannot travel in space, because there’s no air. At that moment, Brenda Bongos decided to become a sort of musical astronaut.

With the help of a lot of time, a lot of books, and a lot of work, Brenda built a space bubble. This was a big glass ball connected to a machine which sucked out all the air inside. All that would be left inside was a drum kit and a chair. Brenda got into the space suit she had made, entered the bubble, turned on the machine, and...
She played those drums like a wild child!

It wasn't long before Brenda Bongos - 'The Musical Astronaut' - had become very famous. So many people came to see her play in her space bubble that she had to mount a pair of speakers so that everyone could listen to her play. Shortly afterwards she came out of the bubble and started giving concerts. Her fame spread so much that the government proposed that she form part of a unique space journey. Finally, Brenda was a real musical astronaut, and had gone far beyond her first ambition of playing drums in a band.

Years later, when they asked her how she had achieved all this, she thought for a moment, and said,
""If those old people next-door hadn't mattered so much to me, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths to find a solution, and none of this would have ever happened."""
An Allergic Wizard,,Respect,"Once upon a time there was a good, cheerful wizard who loved to use his magic to make everyone happy. He was also quite an unusual wizard because he was allergic to a load of different foods. He had to be very careful what he put in his mouth. He was always being invited to parties, and he would always gladly accept, because he always had new tricks and games to try out.

In the beginning, everyone was considerate about his allergies, and they took special care to prepare food that he would be able to eat safely. But as time went on, people tired of having to prepare special foods for him. They began to forget his dietary requirements. After having enjoyed his magic, people would leave him by himself, and the parties became less enjoyable. Sometimes they didn't even bother to tell him what was in the food, and, more than once, he ended up with a black tongue, a red face, and a very itchy body.

Angry at such lack of consideration, he waved his wand and cast a huffy spell that gave everyone a special allergy. Some became allergic to birds or frogs, others to fruit or meat, some to raindrops... And so, each person had to take special care from then on. Whenever people met up to eat or have a party, they ended up having to go to the doctor. 

Ending parties in this way was such a pain that, gradually, people began making an effort to learn what each other’s allergies were. Now they would prepare everything carefully, so that they could have a good time together without getting sick. Visits to the doctor decreased, and in less than a year, life in town returned to normal, filled with parties and celebrations, always attended by the wizard, who gave life and joy to the occasion. Even better, now he could stay and enjoy the whole party. No one would have suspected that, in that town, every single person was strongly allergic to something.

Some time later, without anyone knowing, the wizard waved his wand again and undid the spell. The people had learned well how to be considerate and respectful towards others, and how they could enjoy each others' company even better just by making a little effort to adapt to each and every person."
Naughty kid,,Respect,"Once upon a time, there was a very naughty boy, who used to hit and treat his classmates badly he was disrespectful. One day, he went for a walk with his parents, he took lots of toys before going out and they went to the park; which had many games, lots of trees and a lake.

There were ducks and fishes in the lake, and he was having so much fun.

He was there without obeying his dad and mom, Hitting people, yelling at them and saying swear words (that is not right).

He went running somewhere to hide, so his parents could not see him, they were very worried, thinking something had happened to him.


When the kid realized he was alone started to cry reconsidering his behaviour; because he knew he had to obey and not be rude to his friends and mates.

His parents arrived where the kid and they do not want to start an argument with him they want the good for him so they explained to him that he could not hit or insult people because lots of them take care of him and want his good. For example, Educational people (teachers, grandfathers…) are the same as children, they have to be friends and get along well, having affection.

The family was better after the shock passed, and they all ate and laughed happily at the park.

And that is the end of the story…"
THE SINCERE WITCH,,Honesty,"Once upon a time there was a witch who always said what she was thinking. She was the most honest witch at all times.

That was her problem. She got into trouble sometimes because of her honesty. One day she wanted to capture a monster and said: “Monster! Stay still, I need to cast a spell on you and I can´t if you are moving!”.  And of course, when the monster heard this, he ran away and never came back.
That happened often to her, so it was impossible for her to capture anybody.

She was very worried about it, so one day she went to the witches castle to talk to them: “I´m not worthy of this job, I can´t be a witch”, and she started crying.

The superior witch approached her and said: “I have an idea. You are going to be our honesty trainer“.

The sincere witch didn´t understanding anything, but the superior witch continued: “You are the most sincere witch we know and that´s an important virtue. From now on, we will have a meeting with you every week and you’ll tell us how to improve our work, ok? You are going to be our trainer!”.

And so that is what she did. She was sincere with the rest of the witches in every meeting, and they all progressed positively thanks to the sincere witch."
THE HONEST PRINCESS,,Honesty,"Once upon a time there was a princess called Tanya, who lived in a very, very, very big castle. The princess’s parents, that is to say, the king and queen, wanted her to marry a handsome knight called Norman, who would often visit them to discuss the land they shared, so Tanya and Norman saw plenty of each other.

Unfortunately Tanya didn’t love him. Although they got on well enough, she didn’t much like him, for Norman was very boastful.

One day, Tanya the princess was talking to Norman about the new decorations the king and queen were going to make in the castle, when suddenly Norman changed the subject and said: “Tanya, I like you a lot. In fact, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”

The princess was shocked but instead of firm “NO“, she said: “Norman, you’re a very handsome knight, but I like to be honest with people. So I’m going to tell you what I don’t like about you, which is this: firstly, you’re a show-off, because you like boasting about the clothes you wear when really a person’s clothes aren’t that important; secondly, you spit in the street which is disgusting, and lastly, I’m not going to marry you just because my parents tell me to: I’m going to marry aman I really love.”

Norman reflected long and hard on what the princess had said. To begin with, he felt bad about her opinion of him, but he soon cheered up when he realised that all the things she mentioned were things he could change. It wasn’t his personality that annoyed her, but his behaviour.
So Norman began trying not to brag about his clothes, and started to feel happy in more modest clothing. He also learned not to spit in the street so as not to look horrible and coarse, and he felt better about that, too. And finally, he went to talk to the king and queen to ask them not to talk to the princess Tanya about him, and that way she wouldn’t feel pressured into marrying him.

Tanya and Norman continued spending time together and gradually Tanya began to notice the change in his habits. Seeing that he no longer did horrible things, she also began to notice other details about him, and to like him.

Eventually the princess fell in love and married him.

So you see how the princess’s honesty gave the knight the chance to think and change a few little things that had upset her. Honesty helps people find solutions to lots of problems."
LILY THE ANT,,Honesty,"Lily the ant is queen of the biggest ant´s nest in the region and today was her birthday. She had organized a festival to celebrate it, a big party where ants came from all around the world to attend.
There were red ants, black ants, weaver ants, leaf cutter ants from South America, and even the strange but friendly crazy ants. They were all there in the big hall, eating and drinking non-stop and they had all brought presents for Lily. It was at that moment when, Lily ant, seeing her friends there altogether, stood on the hall platform and thanked them for coming fro all over the world, and then said:

– “Sisters, I want to tell you my great feat and the reason why I´m now the greatest queen of all ants”

All the ants pricked up their antennas and listened the queen´s words.

-“One sunny afternoon” – said Lily – “when, walking through the leafy and green forest I met a huge and angry buffalo who, proud of his strength, wanted to fight me, but I punched him first and fractured his big jaw. The poor buffalo left crying while I left singing happily. I am Lily, the bravest ant in the forest, everybody fears me and nobody faces me!”
“Oh! you are the best” – said the weaver ants – “but not the fiercest” – replied the leaf cutter from South America.

-“My fame…” – continued Lily – “has grown so much since then that, one morning during breakfast, a big tiger screamed at me:

Come here brave ant! Everybody in the forest fears you and nobody faces you! 

That´s right! – I said, and I  kicked him and knocked him down.

I am the bravest ant in the forest, everybody fears me and nobody faces me!” – She continued by saying – “I fought against an elephant, a polar bear, the furious lion and even against tanks of war, but I pushed them all into the water with my little legs. Once in the sea, a shark wanted to eat me, but I bit him and broke his fin.”

Suddenly, there was a big noise in the ant´s nest and a huge red beetle appeared. – “Lily, the ant!” – said the huge insect – “Let´s see if you are as brave as you say, fight with me.”

But Lily was shocked and trembled with fear. She said:

“Dear ants, nobody should lie, as things can go bad for liars be honest in your life . I´m a normal ant. I can´t even pursue a flea. I could die from a frog’s breath.”

At that moment that the beetle said: “I just wanted you to tell the truth.” – And then, he left."

RAINY DAY,Osotoon,Patience,"It was a rainy day, one of those days on which the rain looks beautiful.
Alex was looking out of his window anxious to go out to play waiting  impatiently for the rain to stop.
The day was so grey that it looked sad. Even the trees looked like they were crying with so many drops falling from their branches. But Alex kept smiling.
The rain stopped after a while, and Alex and his friends went out happy that they could now play all together. The clouds started to disappear and the sun began to shine and just at that moment a big rainbow crossed the sky.
It was a beautiful moment for Alex and his friends who learnt to be patient and appreciate every moment of their life."
PETER AND THE MYSTERIOUS BRIEFCASE,,Honesty,"Every friday, Peter went home back from school and thought about all the things he would do over the weekend. Even if the way was longer through the park, he liked to walk home that way so he could see other children playing.

That day Peter finished class earlier than normal and decided to stay in the park and play. He slid down the slide and suddenly something appeared at his feet. It was a briefcase.
Peter opened it, but there was nothing inside except for a paper with a phone number and an address written on it. But as it was late, he went back home. That night he couldn’t stop thinking about the briefcase. – “Who had left it there?, Should I return it?, or should I forget about it? It’s just an empty briefcase, anyway.” 
The day after, Peter decided to look for the owner of the briefcase. He arrived at the house and knocked on the door. An old man opened the door and said, – “Hi kid, what do you want?” – “I found this briefcase yesterday and I wanted to give it back to you.”- said Peter.

“Wow! I thought nobody would return it to me after I had left it there!”- the old man said – “Did you leave it there on purpose?” – asked Peter – “Yes boy, I wanted to check if honest people still exist, and now I have my answer Yes boy, I wanted to check if honest people still exist, and now I have my answer there is people still said the truth ”..

MIKE´S MAGIC PENCIL,,Honesty,"Once upon a time, there was a 7 year old boy named Mike.  One day, as Mike was walking through the playground at school, he found something half buried in the dirt.  He took a good look at it but was not able to recognise what the object was.

Mike found a small stick to help him dig up the object, and after a few minutes Mike was able to pull out the object. He finally saw that it was only an old pencil. “Oh, it’s only an old pencil,” he said, disappointed.

He decided to take the pencil with him, even though it hadn’t been a great discovery.  The next day, he took the pencil to school without realising that it was no ordinary pencil, the pencil was actually very special.
That day, Mike’s Maths teacher decided to give them a surprise quiz.  Mike had not studied his maths as he was a little bit lazy when it came to his studies, and his grades were proof of that.

But something amazing happened during the quiz. Mike didn’t know any of the answers, but the magic pencil kept moving around the page solving each and every one of the maths problems.

“This is impossible!” said Mike.  “Mike, if you talk again I am going to have to fail you” said his Maths teacher.

Mike was the first to finish the quiz.  He turned it in, took his pencil, and went straight to the playground to play.
A few days later, the Maths teacher had graded the quizzes, and she returned them to the students. Everyone was surprised to see that Mike had scored a 10 out of 10.

Mike was very happy with his grade, but the more he thought about it, the more something didn’t feel quite right.  “Why am I so proud of myself?, I really didn’t do anything, this old pencil did all the work for me.”

For 15 minutes, Mike thought long and hard, whether it was right or wrong to use the magic pencil again to take his tests effortlessly. He decided never to use it again, as using it meant cheating and lying to everyone else and to himself . Using the pencil again meant he would never make any effort to study or work hard.

That is how Mike figured out that hard work and be an  honest person is what helps you to be proud of yourself when you want to achieve your goals.  It is not fair to get the same grades as your classmates without having studied."
THE PATIENCE OF THE CLOWN,,Patience,"Once upon a time there was a clown called Jobst who really loved to act in the circus and could never wait until it was his turn to start his performance.

he was curious about what people  will react 
This happened everyday,  and so when it was the real moment to start his performance, he was not in the mood to act.
Mary, the trapeze artist, went to talk to Jobst. “You need to be more patient. We need you, if you don’t act when it is your turn we won’t be a complete circus“.
Jobst understood Mary, and realised that he had to be more patient so as to not affect his mates´ work.
The next day, Jobst waited until it was his turn to act and made all the children laugh and have fun during his performance."
Fear is soft and smooth,,Brave,"Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark.
One day her Aunt Valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her Aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened.
""A great many times, Marina,"" answered her Aunt, ""I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment"".
Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark?
""I'll tell you a secret, Marina. It was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. They can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened"".
""It's true!"" said Marina, intrigued, ""Can you tell me that secret?""
""Of course! The secret is to change your eyes. Since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. All you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. Shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. Let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. But do it using your hands as eyes... and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear"".
Marina accepted, but she was rather worried. She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this. When her parents took her to bed, she herself put out the light. After a little while, she felt afraid of one of the shadows in the bedroom. Following the advice of Aunt Valerie, she closed the eyes of her face and opened the eyes of her hands. And, summoning up all her courage, she determinedly went over to touch that mysterious shadow...
The next morning Marina came running into the kitchen, a big smile on her face, and a song on her lips. ""The monster is so soft and smooth!..."" she cried,
""It's my teddy bear!"""
The island of two sides,,Brave,"The Mokoko tribe lived on the wrong side of the island of two faces. The two sides, separated by a great cliff, were like night and day. The good side was watered by rivers and was filled with trees, flowers, birds and easy and abundant food, while on the wrong side there was hardly any water or plants, and wild beasts crowded together. The Mokoko had the misfortune of having always lived there, with no way to cross to the other side. Their life was hard and difficult: they hardly had food and drink for everyone and they lived in permanent terror of the beasts, who would regularly come and eat some tribe member.
Legend told that some of their ancestors had been able to cross with just the help of a small pole, but for many years not a single tree had grown that would be strong enough to make such a pole, so few Mokoko believed this was possible, and they had become accustomed and resigned to their difficult, resigned life, suffering hunger and dreaming of not ending up as some peckish beast's dinner.
But nature had it that, precisely along the edge of the cliff separating the two sides of the island, a skinny but strong tree grew, with which they could build two poles. The feeling of anticipation was enormous and there was no doubt among the tribe as to whom they would choose to use the poles: the great chief and the witch doctor.
But when the two of them were given their opportunity to make the jump, they felt so afraid that they didn't dared to: they thought that the pole could break, or it would not be long enough, or that something would go wrong during the jump ... and they put so much energy into these thoughts that the resulting fear caused them to give in. And when they saw that this could lead them to being teased and taunted, they decided to invent some old stories and legends about failed jumps to the other side. And they told so many of these tales and they spread so much that there was no Mokoko who did not know how reckless and foolish you would have to be to even attempt the jump. And there lay the poles, available to anyone wanting to use them, but abandoned by all, because taking up one of these poles had become, by dint of repetition, the most unbecoming thing a Mokoko could do. It was a betrayal of the values of suffering and resistance which so distinguished the tribe.
But into that tribe were born Naru and Ariki, a pair of young hearts truly wanting a different life and, encouraged by the strength of their love, one day decided to take up the poles. Nobody stopped them, but everyone did try to discourage them, trying to convincing them of the dangers of jumping, using a thousand explanations.
-""And what if what they say is true?""
wondered the young Naru.
-""Don’t' worry. Why do the talk so much about a leap they've never done? I too am a bit scared, but it doesn't look so difficult,""
replied Ariki, ever determined.
-""But if it goes wrong, it would be a terrible end,""
continued Naru, undecided.
-""Perhaps the jump will go badly, and perhaps not. But staying forever on this side of the island surely won't work out well either. Do you know of anyone whose death did not come from being either eaten by the wild beasts or from famine? That too is a terrible end, although it still seems far away to us.""
-""You're right, Ariki. And if we wait much longer we won't have the strength to make the leap ... Let's do it tomorrow.""
And on the next day, Naru and Ariki jumped to the good side of the island. When taking up the poles, taking their run up, while feeling their desire, the fear hardly allowed them to breathe. And while flying through the air, helpless and without support, they felt that something surely must have gone wrong and certain death awaited them. But when they landed on the other side of the island and happily hugged each other, they thought the jump really hadn't been so bad after all.
And as they ran away to discover their new life, behind them they could hear, like a whispering choir:
-""It was just luck.""
-""Well… maybe tomorrow.""
-""What a terrible jump! Had it not been for the pole ...""
And Naru and Ariki understood why so few people took the leap: because on the bad side of the island you only ever heard the resigned voices of people without dreams, people filled with fear and despair, people who would never jump ..."
"Alina, the dragon guardian",,Honesty,"In faraway Moldan, the land of the brave dragon guardians, every time a child is born they are assigned a dragon, who they have to watch over for their entire life. Every dragon is kept locked up by a “7 Lies” lock which is attached by magic to their guardian.
In Moldan, boys and girls train and prepare their hearts to combat all lying because, once they reach the age of seven, the dragons will be big enough to cause havoc. Alina knew this very well. She was dying of curiosity to know what would happen on the day after her dragon’s seventh birthday.
Nothing happened. Life went on as normal, and the same was true every day after that. Alina started to grow impatient and every day she would visit the place where her dragon remained locked up.
“What’s the point in being a guardian if I don't see my dragon and I don't have to do anything special?
The dragon saw her doubts and his evil spirit took on the shape of a mischievous boy who approached her.
“Wow, a female dragon guardian who has doubts…”
“I don’t have any doubts” Alina said, trying to justify herself and appearing offended.
“If that’s the case, why are you here?”
“I’m looking for flowers”.
“And they're so special that you have to look for them here specifically?”
“Yes, because they are magic flowers”
“And why are they magic?” the boy asked further.
“They help to cure very serious illnesses”
“Who do you want to cure?”
“My grandmother”
“Your poor grandmother. What illness does she have?”
“A very rare one, that affects her skin”
“How many days will it take to heal her with those flowers?”
“3”, Alina invented further.
“No: 7!”
“What?”
“7 lies!” shouted the boy while, at the same time, changing his voice and appearance, transforming into a giant dragon.
“Free at last! Ha Ha Ha! That was easy.
You are the worst dragon guardian in the world, you fibber!
Ha Ha Ha!”
The dragon flew off. Unfortunately, it didn't take it long to find the little village and terrorise the guardians. Everybody wondered who could have let it escape but Alina was scared and said nothing. Although the dragon’s power increased with every lie the girl told, it was never enough so at night it transformed into the naughty boy to bother the girl with his questions to extract new lies.
Poor Alina no longer knew what to say to hide the fact that she had let the dragon escape.
Until one day she couldn't take it anymore. Trapped by the shame of her constant lying, and by the pain of causing so much havoc, she decided to undertake one last act of courage: to confess to what she had done and face the dragon alone. When everyone was gathered together she stood up and said:
- It was me who let the dragon escape. Since then I have been telling lie after lie to cover it up ...
Before she could finish the sentence, she felt a terrible fire burning in her chest, and a lightning bolt shot out from inside her. The bolt of lightning swept the skies for a few seconds until it struck the dragon and trapped it, dragging it back to the village like a little lamb. Thanks to that magic bolt, Alina was able to lock the dragon up again, and only then did the bolt and pain disappear from her chest, leaving a fiery mark that never faded.
That is how the guardians discovered the incredible power unleashed by confessing to a lie. However, they still prefer to tell the truth always because, as Alina explained, no matter how powerful a confession was, it hurt really badly..."
"Alina, the dragon guardian",,Brave,"In faraway Moldan, the land of the brave dragon guardians, every time a child is born they are assigned a dragon, who they have to watch over for their entire life. Every dragon is kept locked up by a “7 Lies” lock which is attached by magic to their guardian.
In Moldan, boys and girls train and prepare their hearts to combat all lying because, once they reach the age of seven, the dragons will be big enough to cause havoc. Alina knew this very well. She was dying of curiosity to know what would happen on the day after her dragon’s seventh birthday.
Nothing happened. Life went on as normal, and the same was true every day after that. Alina started to grow impatient and every day she would visit the place where her dragon remained locked up.
“What’s the point in being a guardian if I don't see my dragon and I don't have to do anything special?
The dragon saw her doubts and his evil spirit took on the shape of a mischievous boy who approached her.
“Wow, a female dragon guardian who has doubts…”
“I don’t have any doubts” Alina said, trying to justify herself and appearing offended.
“If that’s the case, why are you here?”
“I’m looking for flowers”.
“And they're so special that you have to look for them here specifically?”
“Yes, because they are magic flowers”
“And why are they magic?” the boy asked further.
“They help to cure very serious illnesses”
“Who do you want to cure?”
“My grandmother”
“Your poor grandmother. What illness does she have?”
“A very rare one, that affects her skin”
“How many days will it take to heal her with those flowers?”
“3”, Alina invented further.
“No: 7!”
“What?”
“7 lies!” shouted the boy while, at the same time, changing his voice and appearance, transforming into a giant dragon.
“Free at last! Ha Ha Ha! That was easy.
You are the worst dragon guardian in the world, you fibber!
Ha Ha Ha!”
The dragon flew off. Unfortunately, it didn't take it long to find the little village and terrorise the guardians. Everybody wondered who could have let it escape but Alina was scared and said nothing. Although the dragon’s power increased with every lie the girl told, it was never enough so at night it transformed into the naughty boy to bother the girl with his questions to extract new lies.

My little world has broken,,Brave,"Once upon a time there was a spring who lived happily and safely inside a pen. Although he heard many noises coming from outside, he lived believing that outside his world inside the pen, there was nothing good. Even just to think about leaving his pen made him so scared that he was quite content to spend his life compacting and stretching himself again and again inside that tiny space.
However, one day, the ink ran out, and when the pen's owner was busy changing it, there was an accident. The spring was flung through the air and landed in the toilet drain, well out of sight. Terrified, and cursing his bad luck, the spring was flushed through pipe after pipe, each time thinking it might be his end. During the journey, he did not dare open his eyes out of pure fear. Nor did he every stop crying. Swept away by the water, he travelled on and on and on, until he ended up in a river. When the river current lost its force, and the spring could see that things had calmed down a bit, he stopped crying and listened all around him. Hearing birdsong and wind in the trees, he felt encouraged to finally open his eyes. What the spring saw was the pure, crystal waters of the river, the rich green rocks of the riverbed, and all kinds of fish of many colours, whose skin seemed to dance under the sunlight. Now he understood that the world was much greater than the space inside the pen, and that there had always been many things outside, waiting to be enjoyed.
After spending a while playing with the fish, he went over to the riverbank, and then moved on to a field of flowers. There he heard weeping. He followed the sound, which took him to a lovely flower that had been flattened by a rabbit, and could no longer stand up straight. The spring realised that he could help the flower, so he offered to be his support. The flower accepted, and slipped through the middle of the spring. There they lived happily together. And they would always laugh when remembering how the spring used to think that all there was to life was being a sad and fearful spring."
LOVE DROPS,,Friendship,"The girl´s walk was awesome, she was enjoying nature, contemplating the landscape, the forest, appreciating environmentalism, she felt like she was in a magic place without any negative feelings.

Two more drops touched her face and they were friendship and respect. She realized that she could also learn these values at school.  She could learn the value of respect by respecting her teachers and schoolmates, and by fulfilling her obligations at school such as doing homework and helping her classmates.
The girl was pleased with everything she was learning. She understood that friendship is essential in life and that it is important to take care of your friends, to respect and love them, and to understand and support them.

Humility and honesty were the next moral rain drops dropping onto the girl. It is very important to understand these values for if somebody doesn´t have these values they won’t be a good person. telling truth and Not lying, not stealing and not lying to yourself, are some of the characteristics of these human values.

Suddenly it started to rain hard. She smiled, happy to be learning the lessons of God with his message captured in the magic drops. She learnt that the love of one’s neighbour begins by understanding the love of God and that it is important to honor and respect our parents, family and friends, to be generous, supportive and kind, and to help without expecting anything in return. Only in this way can society be more humanitarian and be more understanding of moral values."

LAWRENCE’S TOY,,Respect,"Lawrence was a little boy of 8 years old who loved playing with his toys. On the whole he was a good boy and always got very good marks at school. That’s why one Christmas Santa Claus had arrived loaded with toys for Lawrence, for Lawrence had written to tell Santa that his school results were better than last year’s and that was why he wanted more toys.
Among the presents Santa gave Lawrence was a magic blackboard where you could write or draw anything you liked, but which erased everything when you shook it. Without a doubt, it was the Christmas present he liked most of all, for he spent hours and hours playing with it.
After the holiday was over, Lawrence decided to take the magic blackboard to school to show his classmates. But Liam, the naughtiest boy in the class, ran off with Lawrence’s board and teased him all through break.



“Liam, give me my board back! this is disrespectful!” shouted Lawrence. But Liam was taller than Lawrence and held it above his head so that Lawrence couldn’t reach it.
“Go on Lawrence, jump!” teased Liam.


“Don’t erase my pictures!” Lawrence kept yelling.
But after no success, Lawrence decided to go and fetch a teacher to tell them what was happening. So he marched over to his class teacher and said: “Sir, sir! Liam is rude he has taken my toy away and won’t give it back!” The teacher went to find Liam to tell him to return the magic board.
“Liam, give Lawrence’s toy back now,” ordered the teacher firmly and sternly.
And so it was that Lawrence got his beloved toy back, the magic board from Santa Claus. And Liam was put in detention for a week and given lots of homework for having been naughty.
That was how Liam learned that being rude towards his classmates and fight with them had only caused problems to himself, and from then on he never tormented anyone again.
